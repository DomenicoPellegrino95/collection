  "text": "Henningsen's <I>Artichoke</I> lamp built on his successes in redefining lighting for modern interiors starting in 1924, and his elegant solutions endure in production by Louis Poulsen today. Henningsen originally created the <I>Artichoke</I> for the interior of the Langelinie Pavilion in Copenhagen in 1958.  Designed as a modern chandelier, the lamp, inspired by the form of the globe artichoke, is comprised of seventy-two multiple overlapping copper panels (\"leaves\"), the interiors of which have been sprayed pink for light diffusion, hung from twelve vertical metal arches. This is one of the larger and more commanding examples of the design. The overall effect is layered, sculptural, and dramatic, showing the growing exuberance of Nordic design after the Second World War.  \r\n\r\n",
