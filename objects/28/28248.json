  "text": "The earliest lead glazed pottery has been found in the tombs of Middle Western Han. This was a revolutionary ware in that it marked the beginning of controlled colored glazes, primarily green, yellow, and brown. The term \"lead glaze\" refers to the addition of lead flux to the glaze compound which lowers the melting point of the glaze thereby speeding up the firing process. The <I>hu<I> shown to the left is brown glazed and, like this example, molded with a lively hunting scene around its shoulder. The shapes and lead glaze colors shown here are typical of Han storage jars made specifically for tomb burial. They contained nourishment for the afterlife.",
