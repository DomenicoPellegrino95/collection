  "text": "The Bakewell firm in Pittsburgh is famous for introducing high quality table glass to America.  They are also known for encasing glass with sulphide medallions of important Americans, such as Benjamin Franklin and George Washington, similar to the sulphide of the kneeling slave seen on the English cologne bottle nearby.  The neoclassical motifs on this tumbler show Bakewell's supurb cutting and engraving skills.  The heart and two kissing doves suggest the name of this type of tumbler, as it was often given as a token of friendship, especially among courting couples.",
