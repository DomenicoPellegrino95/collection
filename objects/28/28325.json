  "text": "The bridal belt was worn by the urban elite of northern Moroccan cities. This enormous belt - 106 inches long with 35 inches of braided fringe on either side - would usually be folded lengthwise and wrapped several times around the bridal caftan. The beautiful accessories were created using a complex technique called lampas, requiring a team of several specialized weavers to complete.\r\n\r\nThe design patterns on the belt are significant. The floral and geometric patterns recall Spanish Islamic influence. At each end of the belt, one can see the eight-pointed star, associated with both Moroccan and Islamic values, and the hamsa, or Hand of Fatima, a protective sign.",
