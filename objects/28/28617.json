  "text": "Huipiles created in Tecpán are very unusual in that the design of the everyday huipil is so dramatically different from the ceremonial huipil. Most villages use a combination of higher quality materials and more elaborate patterning to differentiate festive use huipiles from those intended for daily use. In Tecpán, the size, shape, color and layout of the two styles are entirely different. The use of traditional Maya symbols is common to both types of garment, however, featuring two motifs that represent the sun: diamonds with emanating rays and diamonds with scrolls (quatrefoil flowers).",
  "description": "Two four-selvage panels,  ground is a pattern of thin brown and orange stripes alternating with wider red stripes; brocaded silk tie at neck. Six bands of discontinuous supplementary weft patterning of variations of rosette design in magenta, acqua, white and purple.",
