  "text": "Most bark paintings illustrate a particular Dreaming, a story that explains the creation of life, people, and animals. In Aboriginal culture, only those with knowledge and ownership of certain Dreamings can depict the corresponding designs.\r\n\r\nThis bark painting tells the story of the two Djang'kawu sisters, creator ancestors who traveled to the Arnhem Land region in northern Australia by canoe. Along the way, they named the sea animals like the swordfish, starfish, anemones, and squid shown here.",
