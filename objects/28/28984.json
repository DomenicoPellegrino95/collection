  "text": "This pattern is known today as \"Bengal Tiger\" and closely mirrors a pattern by the Worcester porcelain factory of the 1770s of that name. The Worcester porcelain, in turn, was copied from an early eighteenth century Chinese pattern. The harsh colors used on this plate are not typical of either of the earlier versions, and hence this Chinese edition of the \"Bengal Tiger\" was not popular for long. It is likely that it was ordered by a china shop to compete with Worcester.",
