  "text": "Quetzaltenango women's ceremonial huipiles are unique in that they are worn as veils rather than as blouses. The garment is draped over the woman like a poncho and her face is positioned in the circular opening. These dramatic huipiles are used both as wedding clothes and for Cofrad√≠a rituals, but the embroidered ribbon that faces the opening features images, presumably, of Adam and Eve, which make it likely that this particular piece was used as a wedding garment.",
  "description": "Three panels sewn together, continuous and discontinuous supplementary weft patterning; lower section is white on white, upper is patterned in blue, magenta, yellow on white ground. Patterns include zigzags, lozenge forms, pairs of small birds perch on plant-like forms and at the points of some zigzags. Simply  embroidered neck band and randas.",
