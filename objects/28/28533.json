  "text": "Alexander Girard was a multitalented architect and designer whose vibrant textiles and folk-art inspired interiors were akin to those of his friends, the designers Charles and Ray Eames. In 1965, he was commissioned by Braniff Airlines to help create a lively and contemporary visual identity for the airline, as they proclaimed \"the end of the plain plane\". This he did with the creation of numerous fabrics--including the signature \"Checker\"--each produced in several different color schemes, that were used for aircraft seating, wall panels, and Girard-designed lounge furniture.",
