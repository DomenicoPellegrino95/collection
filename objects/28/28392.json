  "text": "The weavers of San Juan Comalapa produce two distinct styles of huipil. The <I>mero<I> (pure) Comalapa huipil is distinguished by the use of a <I>cuyuscate<I> (natural brown cotton) or white ground, a bright red <I>creya<I> (band) at the shoulders and <I>rujiki 7al<I> bands of narrow stripes) separating rows of patterning. The newer <I>sanmartineco<I> (in the style of San Mart√≠n) huipil is totally different with its indigo, black, or green ground cloth and the use of modern, naturalistic floral imagery.\r\n\tBoth styles have everyday and a festive versions which are differntiated by subtle nuances. The ceremonial <I>mero Comalapa<I> huipil is very large and is worn like a poncho over an everyday huipil. The festive <I.>sanmartineco<I> huipil has elaborate floral designs brocaded in silk or sedalina yarn rather than cotton\r\n",
