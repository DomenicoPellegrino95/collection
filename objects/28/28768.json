  "text": "This remarkable vest is composed of tiny bamboo beads. In centuries past, Chinese elites wore garments like this under formal ensembles that incorporated multiple robes. Worn close to the skin, they prevented costly silk textiles from soiling through contact with oil and perspiration. Alternatively, they were layered between robes in order to regulate body temperature by trapping warm air in cold weather and facilitating ventilation when temperatures rose. Since bamboo grows to maturity very quickly, these luxury accessories made innovative use of a renewable plant resource. ",
