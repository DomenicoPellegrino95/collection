  "text": "A fanciful type of bed covering in Japan, called <I>yogi<I> (literally \"night clothes\") consists of a quilted blanket in the shape of a kimono. Heavily padded with cotton wadding, the <I>yogi<I> was spread over the sleeper, decorative back side up, and the collar tucked snugly under the chin and shoulders. As part of a bridal trousseau, they were sometimes decorated with the groom's family crest. In this case, the crest consists of three oak leaves. The bottom of the blanket is decorated with a pattern of pine branches and folded paper cranes--both symbols of longevity.",
