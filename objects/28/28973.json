  "text": "During the Northern Sung dynasty (960-1126), the god Hsuan-wu (Dark Warrior) was transformed into Chen-wu, the perfected warrior. Chen-wu was associated with a powerful group of Taoist celestial marshals known as the Four Saints. These gods were perceived as spirit-guardians of the Taoist faith. Small ceramic sculptures such as this were typically used in domestic settings.",
