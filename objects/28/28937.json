  "text": "Sedan boxes are so-called because their T-shaped design allows them to rest across the owner's knees on the carrying rails of the sedan chair while travelling. These boxes were used to bear documents, brushes, seals, money, and other valuables. The shape became synonymous with the scholar official and thus became a necessary accessory for any well-to-do gentleman.",
