  "text": "Trousers and shirts of this cut are worn by men in many parts of Guatemala and were inspired in part by contact with Europeans. As with the women's clothing, the distinctive patterns incorporated into the handwoven fabric reflect regional differences.  As can be seen when comparing this shirt from Almolonga and the shirt from Todos Santos, depicted in the accompanying photo, there are a variety of  collar treatments. The collar is a part of the costume where men's and women's clothes often share similar design variations.\u000bThe shirt is worn tucked into the top of the trousers and secured with a belt (banda), such as example #12 in the case to the right.\u000b",
