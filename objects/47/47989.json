  "text": "The Bible describes the story of two infants laid before Solomon, one dead and one alive. Each woman insists the living child is her son, whereupon Solomon orders the boy cut in two. One woman quickly retracts her claim, revealing to the wise king her identity as the true mother (1 Kings 3:16-28). The bird at right may hint at which woman is false, for as noted in the Wisdom of Solomon 1:5, a righteous spirit \"will flee from deceit.\"",
