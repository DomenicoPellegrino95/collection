  "text": "While celebrating Mass in Rome, Pope Gregory the Great reportedly saw Christ miraculously rise above a sarcophagus, accompanied by symbols of the Passion. This legend gave birth to the Gregorian Man of Sorrows. With an eye to naturalism, Albrecht Dürer leaned a small devotional picture against the altar, perhaps to model for the viewer how contemplation can lead to visualization. ",
