  "text": "Edmund Blampied grew up on a farm on the English island of Jersey. He spent his childhood among the peasants and laborers, and he knew their pastimes well. Many of his etchings and drypoints are devoted to the islanders' lyrical way of life, both at work and at play. During the German occupation of Jersey in World War II, with art materials in short supply, the determined Blampied engraved his images onto tobacco tins and once did an etching with a sharpened six-inch nail.",
