  "text": "At this time Turks claimed a large share of public attention, owing to the rappid westward advance of the Ottoman empire through conquest.  Durer shows these family members as semi-savages: a partially nude and bare-foot woman, holding a baby, follows the father, a robust warrior.  This unsympathetic portrayal probably reflected contemporary opinion in the Christian north.",
