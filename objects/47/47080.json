  "text": "According to the sixteenth-century biographer Vasari, a number of Dürer's prints reached Florence, among them the Engraved Passion series,where they were  judged to be the ultimate in perfection and quality attainable in the medium of engraving.  Among the Florentine artists who studied them was Jacopo Pontormo (1494-1556).  In 1522-23 while escaping the plague in a monastery outside Florence, Pontormo painted a fresco series illustrating the Passion.  Perhaps attracted to the intensely spiritual nature of the Dürer's depictions, Pontormo based the figures in some of his frescoes on the corresponding scenes in the <I>Engraved Passion<I>.  The <I>Resurrection<I> is one of these.",
