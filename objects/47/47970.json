  "text": "Israhel van Meckenem's series on the vagaries of love was wryly titled \"Scenes from Daily Life.\" In this example, an older gentleman with an unbuttoned hat (and suggestively placed sword) seems unable to satisfy his headstrong young wife. Her more-elegant attire indicates that she married below her social station, probably for financial gain. Clearly, the artist was calling into question the wife's adherence to the middle class moral codes of obedience, modesty, and fidelity.",
