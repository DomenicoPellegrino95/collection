  "text": "Much of the gory non-Gospel detail in the Passion literature was connected to Old Testament prophesies. For example, Isaiah 1:6 (\"From the sole of the foot unto the top of the head, there is no soundness therein\") inspired horrific Flagellation episodes. One tract said Christ was whipped from bottom to top, so his blood would not hide any bit of flesh from his torturers. Such gruesome imagery--and Christ's defenselessness--helped viewers visualize the depth of pain Christ endured on their behalf.",
