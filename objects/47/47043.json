  "text": "The pine trees and plant life atop these cliffs does not seem like the same sultry Syrian desert landscape where St. Jerome lived in solitude. Yet, Dürer’s goal was not historical accuracy; rather he ventured to showcase St. Jerome’s power of mind and soul to withstand the harsh landscape with seeming ease. The Saint’s intensity and heroism are expressed in his wiry body, long noble beard, fiery eyes and commitment to self-punishment. ",
