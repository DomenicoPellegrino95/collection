  "text": "These two prints (and P.3,891) are a wonderful example of the late nineteenth-century trend for collecting multiple states of one image. The William M. Ladd Collection contained both an early trial proof and the later published version of A Likely Place for a Salmon. The trial version, which Ladd acquired from the artist's own collection, was a working proof on which Haden had made significant revisions in black and white chalk. Such notations on preliminary impressions, which a printmaker will make to check progress of a print, can provide valuable insight into the creative process. In this case, we can see Haden working out issues in the water and shoreline as well as the placement of the fisherman on the near bank. ",
