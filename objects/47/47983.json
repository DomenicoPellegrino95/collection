  "text": "Their headgear indicates the allegiances of the jousting, furry wild men: here is the chivalrous clash between the beets and the leeks. Through the extravagant acanthus-like trappings armoring their steeds we catch a glimpse of the intense gaze of the beet partisan and the unfazed smile of the rider for the leeks. In this early work, Israhel is still solidly in the Middle Ages, unencumbered by Renaissance concerns over measuring up to standards from antiquity.",
