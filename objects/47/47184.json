  "text": "Francis Seymour Haden was not a professional artist, but rather a renowned surgeon with a thriving London practice. While studying medicine at the Sorbonne in Paris, he took his first classes in drawing and etching to \"better train the hand and eye for surgery.\" Shortly after establishing his medical practice in London, he began collecting etchings and became an authority on the work of Rembrandt van Rijn. Haden had a press installed in his home, upon which he started to print his own work. His collections and etchings would have a lasting influence on his brother-in-law, James McNeill Whistler.\r\n\r\nHaden's Shere Mill Pond was the first print purchased by William M. Ladd in 1885, and Ladd's interest in Haden's work only increased over the years. When the collection was sold to Herschel V. Jones in 1916, it contained more than 260 of the artist's prints.\r\n",
