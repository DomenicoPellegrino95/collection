  "text": "The foliage in this mock coat of arms shows Albrecht D端rer's brilliant handling of pure ornament. Scholar Charles W. Talbot cited this print as evidence that \"history probably lost its greatest goldsmith\" when D端rer became an artist instead of a goldsmith like his father. This level of ornamental abandon was rarely, if ever, repeated in D端rer's oeuvre.",
