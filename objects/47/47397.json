  "text": "The handful of British artists in L'Estampe originale had an entr√©e through Lucien Pissarro (artist Camille's son), who moved from France to England in 1890. For years Charles Ricketts made a living with his wood-engraved illustrations, effected with minute precision. The looming serpent and ritual scene reflect his somewhat awkward attempt at symbolic meaning, which he probably assumed a French audience would like.",
