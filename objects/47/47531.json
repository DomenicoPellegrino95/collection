  "text": "A simple line from the Old Testament--\"there is no beauty in him, nor comeliness\" (Isaiah 53:2)--was seized upon to justify cruel acts of disfigurement in Passion writings. In this Mocking scene, Christ's oppressors all have some crude means of menacing him, including a screaming trumpet. The assaults were said to leave Christ unrecognizable, an idea suggested by the cloth over his face.",
