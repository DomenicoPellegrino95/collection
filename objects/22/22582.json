  "text": "By the late 18th century, a thriving culinary culture had emerged in Edo that catered to the city's wealthy residents. By the 1830s, printed guides ranking the best restaurants were published regularly and avidly read by food enthusiasts. In addition, restaurants became meeting places for the members of poetry societies and other cultural groups because their members were already regular patrons of popular chefs.\r\n\tThis print, from a set of thirty by Hiroshige depicting the top restaurants in Edo, shows an altercation in front of an establishment called Tagawaya. A man wearing a dark yellow jacket who seems to be drunk has hit a man who now holds a white towel to his forehead, trying to stop the swelling of the lump. Since the restaurant was located right by the Yoshiwara pleasure quarter, a courtesan, shown dressed in the purple gown, is in the party. The fight between the two men may have had something to do with her. \r\n\r\n",
