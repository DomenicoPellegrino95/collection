  "text": "For this autumnal scene Hiroshige was inspired by a poem by Kisen Ho_shi, a 9th century Buddhist priest who lived in the mountains near Uji, southeast of Kyoto. Hiroshige included the poem in the upper portion of the print: \r\n\r\n\t\t\t<I><p>Lowly hut is mine\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>southeast of the capital--\r\n\t\t\t<p>Thus I choose to dwell;\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>And the world in which I live\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>men have named a \"Mount of Gloom.\"<I>\r\n\r\n<p>The melancholy tone of the poem is echoed by Hiroshige's portrait of the poet shown here in a windswept landscape with maple leaves swirling about him. His attention appears to be taken with the sorrowful cry of a deer, shown here in the distance.  ",
