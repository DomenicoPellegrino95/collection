  "text": "Although birds and flowers are not a common subject for fan prints, Hiroshige created a number of fan series with floral designs between the 1840s and 1850s. This is one from a three-print set that features flowers symbolic of good fortune. In addition to their obvious beauty, spotted lilies with their edible roots have long been a source of nutrition in Japan. Thus, they represent an alternative meaning of the ideograph for prosperity (roku), which can connote \"gift.\"",
