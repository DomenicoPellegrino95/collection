  "text": "The <I>Haggadah<I> (telling) is a special text that guides the ceremony of the Passover Seder meal. This is a specially made facsimile of the famous \"Barcelona Haggadah\" in the collection of the British Library since 1844. Named for the heraldic shield it bears resembling the arms of Barcelona, the Haggadah was written and illustrated in the mid fourteenth-century, a time when Spain was home to one of the largest Jewish communities in the world. The beautiful illuminations feature contemporary Jews in scenes from the Exodus and from everyday life. Inscriptions indicate the book's provenance, or history of ownership. For example, Shalom Latif of Jerusalem sold the original to Rabbi Moses ben Abraham of Bologna in 1459, confirming the book left Spain before the expulsion of the Jews by Ferdinand and Isabella in 1492.",
