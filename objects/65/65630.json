  "text": "Leonetto Cappiello's poster for Cinzano Vermouth is radically different from the other alcohol advertisements on display. Rather than a perfectly beautiful woman, Cappiello presents a red and pink zebra bucking against the reins of a toga-wearing rider. This incongruous design represents a new direction in advertising. Cappiello uses an isolated image so vivid and memorable that it makes the product unforgettable, too. While the image he chose may not seem to relate to the brand or what it will do for the consumer, it actually makes an appealing promise about Cinzano's effects. This bizarre sight is just one example of the type of visions that may result from drinking enough of the advertised vermouth. ",
