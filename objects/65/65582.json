  "text": "Tom Phillips's suite of screenprints is an editioned version of several pages from A Humument, the now-classic altered book he produced between 1966 and 1973. The altered book's title is a contraction of its original title, A Human Document, a long-forgotten Victorian novel Phillips found in a London bookstall. Over many months, he \"edited\" each of the individual pages of text through a careful process of drawing and painting. His elaborate modifications both obscured and highlighted individual words and phrases, dramatically transforming the book's narrative from a hackneyed romantic tale to a compelling visual and conceptual puzzle, rich with new meanings and associations.",
