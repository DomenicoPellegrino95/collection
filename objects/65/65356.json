  "text": "Portrayed as a hawk or hawk-headed deity, Horus was god of the sky and protector of pharaoh. The deity appeared early in Egyptian history as the primary god of kingship, a powerful sky symbol representing the total authority of the pharaoh on earth. Horus figures prominently in funerary texts, \"magical\" formulas, and the inscriptions of kings.\r\n<P>Horus also embodied the principle order inherited from the sun god, Re. As such, he was in continuous opposition to the god Seth who represented disorder and chaos. The king of Egypt had to effectively balance both principles of life, order and chaos, to exercise his rule. Statues of Horus acting simultaneously as a protector and manifestation of the reigning king were common in Egyptian art, and cult centers with temples dedicated to this prominent deity were located at Hierakonpolis and Edfu.\r\n\r\n",
