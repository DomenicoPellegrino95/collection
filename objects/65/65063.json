  "text": "The industrious D.Y. Cameron was an etching purist who completed more than 500 plates between 1887 and 1932. The somber beauty of Cameron's native Scotland is reflected in the dark, rich tone of his etchings, especially here in this view of the bridges crossing the Clyde River in Glasgow.",
