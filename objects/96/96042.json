  "text": "At first glance, these charming figures appear to be twelve Tang dynasty court officials participating in some sort of Confucian ritual with one member bowing to another that is slightly raised on a rockwork pedestal. Closer examination reveals a miniature animal sculpted into the top of each figure's court hat. The twelve animals (rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, ram, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig) represent the Chinese twelve year cycle, or zodiac, in which each year is associated with an animal. Few complete sets of zodiac figures have survived from the early Tang dynasty. This is one of only two recorded sets to position the animals in the hats of court officials.",
