  "description": "Embroidered band, warp-twined (LM) edge; Printed lining. Overall cross stitch embroidery on a cotton ground. The hat is constructed of three pieces: a circular crown, a band forming the front and sides, and a wide band extending down the back. There is an attached embroidered border at the bottom of the back band. The back band is partially lined with cotton fabric to draw the edges into a tube form. The crown is lined with silk/cotton ikat; a bull\\'s-eye motif is centered in the crown. Embroidery is cross-stithed through a guaze-like striped fabric.",
