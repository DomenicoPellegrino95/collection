  "text": "The shape of this tray and painted \"gadrooning\" on its lip, resemble those of silver salvers used to hold wine goblets.  The tiled floor depicted is particularly reminiscent of delftware (Chinese-inspired earthenware made in Delft, Holland) suggesting the dish was meant for the Dutch market.  The scene most likely derives from an engraving, as yet unidentified.",
