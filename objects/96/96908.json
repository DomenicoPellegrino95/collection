  "text": "The history of bentwood furniture dates back centuries, but it was Michael Thonet, an enterprising cabinetmaker from Boppard-am-Rein in Germany, who propelled the notion of steam-bending woods (and subsequently, tubular metal) into the 20th century, representing a significant passage from craft to industrial production.  In 1819, Thonet began producing delicate, lightweight Biedermeier designs in his hometown, leading to experiments with laminated wood a decade later.  Having gained the patronage of Prince Metternich, he moved to Vienna where this side chair was made.  Today, this chair serves as a celebrated example in which the stylish forms of Biedermeier furniture converge with a new, revolutionary technology. ",
