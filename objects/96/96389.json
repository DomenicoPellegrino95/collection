There is a woven silk fringe with wrapped silk/cotton tassels on all four sides. There is a silk-on-cotton embroidered finishing band on the bottom edge. The backing is pieced from two different printed cotton fabrics. The fringe and tassels at the upper edge appear to be a later addition; they are a different pattern and color from the rest. woven fringe is in sections of random colors.
