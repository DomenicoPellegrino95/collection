  "text": "Miyamura Hideaki attended Western Michigan University but returned to Japan in order to apprentice with master potter Miura Shurei (born 1942) in Yamanashi Prefecture. During that time he reportedly conducted 10,000 glaze experiments, investigating Chinese-style iridescent temmoku glazes in particular. In order to accentuate his glazes, he makes use of dramatic but simple ceramic shapes--another influence he attributes to Sung dynasty ceramic wares. He now lives and works in Kensington, New Hampshire.",
