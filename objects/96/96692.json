The images may have been copied from a John Cole design in <I>Illustrations in Masonry<I>, published in  1801.  \r\n\r\nClub meetings during the 18th century often included the consumption of great quantities of punch.  In addition to sharing the beverage, drinking from a shared bowl and making group toasts added to the communal experience.",
