  "description": "Braided-net fringe, ikat band at top, Bag back: pieced, striped cloth and printed lining. Black wool ground with polychrome silk embroidery. There is a braided cotton edging which probably was originally finished with tassels. Now, it has been trimmed and turned to the reverse to form a binding. The opening of the bag is outlined in synthetic/cotton ikat fabric. Printed cotton fabric forms the inside surface of the bag. Chain stitch dominates fill.",
