  "text": "Andean hats, or chullo, have been worn by people in the Peruvian region for centuries, providing protection from the harsh climates of both the coast and the highlands. Generally, these colorful hats are elaborately designed in abstract, geometric patterns. The symbols and colors have been used to reflect community affiliations and trends in fashion. The conical shape may come from the historical practice of shaping the heads of babies and children in order to display social rank, beauty, and community identity.",
