  "text": "This coffee and tea set is frequently cited as Paul Follot’s most daring design.  The five-piece service actually fuses Art Nouveau, Modernism, and even bears resemblance to Gothic armor.  The compelling way in which the metal resembles stretched fabric also anticipates elements of Surrealism.  While appearing remarkably avant-garde for its time, the design is perhaps less startling knowing Follot designed textiles throughout his career.  Follot later designed many opulent Art Deco interiors and furnishings and in 1923 became director of the design studio for the grand Parisian store, Bon Marché.",
