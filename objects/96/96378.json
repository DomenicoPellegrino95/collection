  "description": "Printed lining. Multicolored fine cross stitch embroidery in silk and cotton on cotton ground. The embroidery completely covers the ground except for the centers of three green motifs at the bottom.\r\nThere are integral cross stitch borders on the top and sides. Tassels are composed of cotton, silk, and metallic threads (wool, too?). There is a printed cotton backing. The tassel at the PR top corner appears to be a replacement, does not match the others.",
