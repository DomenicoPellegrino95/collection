  "description": "Overall silk cross stitch embroidery on coarse cotton fabric. There is presently no backing, but a glue and paper residue on the reverse suggests a previous mounting for display. At one end are several inches of machine stitching. There is a black and white applied herringbone stitch edging on three sides. One long side has a polychrome cross stitched border. Red, green, yellow.",
