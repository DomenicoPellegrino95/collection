  "text": "Leon Applebaum studied glass in Toledo in the 1960s, where he was caught up in the energy of Littleton and Labino's experiments. His bowls incorporate many colors through the casing process, and display the thick, heavy quality of Swedish glass that he became familiar with while studying at Orrefors in the early 1970s. He states, \"I enjoy exploring the visual dimensions of massive glass and reflective interiors, using transparent colors so that light passes through and brings out the pure beauty and essence of glass.\" Applebaum's latest vessels are manipulated with tools to produce projecting elements, pairing texture with color.",
