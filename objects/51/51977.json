  "text": "While Vice President and Director of Research and Development for the Glass Fibers Division of Johns-Manville Corporation, Labino developed over sixty patents. He had also been building small furnaces and experimenting with glassblowing personally since the 1940s. His experience was therefore incredibly valuable during the 1962 Toledo workshop/symposium that stimulated the studio glass movement. Labino provided glass marbles that would melt at a relatively low temperature, allowing Harvey Littleton and the participants to work with glass without spending valuable time formulating a viable glass formula.<P>Labino retired in 1965 to concentrate on his studio glass. His vases and his sculptures such as <I>Sea-kingdom<I> display his early mastery of color and depth through encasing colored designs in clear glass. Labino believed in the primacy of technique and composition over artistic inspiration, unlike Littleton, who felt that the artist's finished product was most important. \r\n",
