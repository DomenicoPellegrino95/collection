Lover of toads and the smells of Rome, dilletante in philosophy and the fine arts, in love with the feline types.  In Paris, the month of May, 1880.  Augustus Saint-Gaudens made this.\"\r\n\r\nOne of Saint-Gaudens's closest friends, Schiff led a similarly international life.  He was born in New Orleans, educated in France, served as a surgeon in the Confederate Army, briefly practiced medicine in New York City, and then retired to Rome.  Saint-Gaudens named his son Homer Schiff Saint-Gaudens in honor of their friendship.\r\n<P>Schiff was a collector of oriental bronzes, especially of toads and frogs, which perhaps explains the vignette of the toad on this relief.  The portrait is one of the five reliefs that Saint-Gaudens exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1879.",
