He believed it to be near perfection because in it he had successfully expressed the sitter's singular combination of talent and vanity.\r\n<P>Bastien-Lepage was a leading painter of the anti-academic <I>plein-air</I> movement, which advocated the return to the depiction of nature as it is without preconceptions or idealization.  These painters worked in the open air (<I>plein air</I>), portraying real people in everyday situations. Bastien-Lepage was at the height of his career when Saint-Gaudens made this relief in 1879, in return for a full-length portrait of himself by the painter (now lost).  ",
