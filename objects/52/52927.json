  "text": "These extraordinarily early forms by Chihuly reached the present owners through the former wife of local artist George Morrison, who taught with Chihuly at the Rhode Island School of Design in the late 1960s. Chihuly had given them to the Morrisons as a wedding gift at that time. One can see how in his early years of glass experimentation, Chihuly took advantage of the natural qualities of glass to drip and pool, creating loose interpretations of functional objects. ",
