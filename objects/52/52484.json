  "text": "Andrea Mantegna faced a tough patron in the strong-willed Isabella d'Este, who at age 16 married into Mantua's ruling Gonzaga family. She was determined to appear erudite and au courant, and the theme of woman's destructive sexual power was one of her favorites. (Scholars think she even had Mantegna paint Judith and Delilah for her private quarters.) Behind this classically inspired Judith is a sense of deep recession into Holofernes' tent. \r\n\r\nIn Italy, Judith could be viewed in the same light as David, the vanquisher of Goliath. Images of both served as warnings against tyrants, and Judith's watchful look here may convey political courage as well.\r\n",
