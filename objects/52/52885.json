Early in his career, Balch worked in Europe as an international correspondent for American newspapers.  He must have been in Paris in 1878 covering the <I>Exposition Universelle</I> when he met Franz Liszt, who served as president of the exhibition's musical instruments section.  Saint-Gaudens and his wife also spent 1878 in Paris, where he assisted in selecting the United States art entries for the same exhibition.\r\n",
