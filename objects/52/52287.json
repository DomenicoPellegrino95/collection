Rising like a bizarre pedestal rock from the stylized waves, the mountain is similar to depictions of Peng-lai found in Taoist paintings. The reverse is impressed with the three character title, <i>Peng-lai shan<i>, (Mount Peng-lai) and a long, raised inscription describing the paradise followed by the signature, \"made in the Garden of Bamboo Fields and Pure Pines,\" and two seals, \"Harmony Spring.\"",
