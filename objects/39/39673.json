  "text": "This bowl is an example of the excellence for which Chinese Imperial porcelain is known.  Perfection in form, color and decoration come together to create exceptional works which were exclusively for Imperial use. Covered with a rich egg-yolk color glaze known as 'Imperial' yellow, dishes of this kind were made for use at the palace table both in the Ming and Qing Dynasties. \r\nSuch objects possess an undeniable beauty and have long been sought after by foreign traders and collectors. Now, as China emerges as a global economic leader, the cycle of collecting has come full circle as works such as these are being actively sought by Chinese collectors.\r\n",
