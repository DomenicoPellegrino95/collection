  "text": "Luba people trace their ancestry through the mother's family line, and women traditionally occupy important positions in court and political life. Women are considered the foundation of society, a role shown in royal stools like this one in which a female figure literally supports the power of the ruler. <P>At the height of the Luba empire in the 18th and early 19th century, stools were used to distinguish the king and other important leaders from less powerful individuals who sat on the ground.<P>During the early 20th century, African sculpture began to be admired for its aesthetic qualities and was collected by many artists who gained inspiration from this different way of depicting natural forms.  This sculpture was once owned by Pablo Picasso who had an early interest in African art.",
