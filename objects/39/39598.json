  "text": "Two armour-clad figures (lokapalas) flank the bodhisattvas protecting the group from evil forces opposed to Buddhism. These warriors are fully dressed in fanciful armour with grotesque masks adorning the shoulders and stomach areas while the heads are protected by tasseled helmets. The guardians are not mirror images. One has an aggressive face and stands in a combative pose while the other clasps his hands in devotion with an expression of introspection on his face. Unfortunately, the lower legs of both images are now missing. Stucco is more susceptible to water damage than stone or bronze and the extremities of both statues have rotted away revealing protruding ends of the wooden armature around which the clay and stucco image was formed.",
