  "text": "Rich deposits of fine-grained clay have supported a thriving ceramic industry in Tamba, central Honshu, at least since the thirteenth century. The vast majority of Tamba ware consists of large utilitarian vessels designed to meet the daily needs of ordinary people, and included sturdily constructed jars, bottles and mortars. During the seventeenth century, Tamba potters began to cater to the needs of tea enthusiasts. They also experimented with glaze, sometimes pouring glaze or slip around the shoulders of their vessels, allowing it to run down the sides to create pleasingly decorative patterns. The carefully controlled drip pattern of this mizusashi emphasizes its elegant shape.",
