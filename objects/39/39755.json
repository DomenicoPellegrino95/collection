  "text": "Ogata Kenzan is considered one of Japan's greatest ceramic artists. He was the son of a wealthy textile merchant who was well versed in the arts of painting, poetry and calligraphy. As a member of Kyoto's cultured elite, he was connected with the leading tea masters of the time, and his pottery combines the simplicity of tea taste with the decorative approach he championed with his brother, Ogata Korin. This set of plates, used to serve small portions of food during tea ceremonies, combines casually brushed designs with short, poetic inscriptions.",
