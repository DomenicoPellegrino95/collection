  "text": "This unusual menorah was made at Bezalel Academy of Art in Jerusalem. The school was founded in 1906 to teach the arts and crafts and strive to establish a uniquely \"Hebrew\" style of art that would promote unification among Jews returning to Israel. This meant moving away from European regional styles and returning to ancient forms for ritual objects, and, after the Second World War, the development of an abstract, modern aesthetic under Ludwig Wolpert. This classical-style menorah, with its urn, oil lamps and stylized branches, was also part of this endeavor to explore new forms for Judaica, and was probably produced only for a short time.",
