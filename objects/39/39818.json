  "text": "Each Saturday, friends and family are invited into each other's homes to celebrate the Sabbath. As evening falls on Saturday the festival mood is replaced with sadness. During the special ceremony called <I>havdalah</I> (separation) the family says a blessing over a cup of wine, lights a special candle created from several twisted wicks, and inhales from a container of fragrant spices. The sweet fragrance of the spices carries the sweetness of the Sabbath into the week ahead.",
