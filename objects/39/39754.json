  "text": "In addition to rare and refined Chinese vessels, early Japanese tea masters also admired rough, sturdy ceramics produced at domestic kilns for the everyday needs of peasant farmers. They adapted some of these wares for use in the tea ceremony. This small, wide-mouthed jar, for example, was probably first used to store seeds in preparation for the following year's planting. Later, in the hands of a tea master, it was fitted with a lacquered lid and used to hold fresh water. Contributing to the vessel's unpretentious appeal is its slightly distorted shape and irregularly spotted surface caused when natural ash glaze disintegrated in the intense heat of the kiln.",
