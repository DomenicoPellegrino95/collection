  "text": "This coffee pot's commanding conical shape, high domed lid, and angled handle and spout clearly relate to silver coffee and chocolate pots made in England.  Its decoration is an equally compelling example of western influence on Chinese Export porcelain.  The green scales and coloring resemble patterns attributed to Cornelius Pronk, while the delicate insects and flowers take their inspiration from illustrations by Maria Sybilla Merian.\r\n",
