  "text": "This vase was ordered by several Minneapolis businessmen to thank Charles W. West for his contributions to the development of the city of Minneapolis.  West, who appears in the portrait medallion on the reverse of this vase, was a Cincinnati investor and owner of the West Hotel, seen on the front, which stood at Fifth and Hennepin avenues in downtown Minneapolis.  When the West House was dedicated, on November 19, 1884, it was considered one of the best hotels in America.  Its distinctive architecture, by Minneapolis architect LeRoy Buffington (1848-1931), incorporated rooms appointed with the latest technological advancements, including electric lighting; an electrical generating plant; speaking tubes; more than 200 private bathrooms; and hot and cold running water in every room.",
