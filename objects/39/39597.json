  "text": "Flanking the central Buddha are a pair of bodhisattvas seated on lotus bases. The miniature golden images of Amitaba Buddha in their crowns identify them as Kuan-yin, the Bodhisattva of Mercy and Compassion, one of the most popular deities in Chinese Buddhism. The right figure is seated in the \"royal ease\" (maharajalasana) position with one leg up and one down. The right hand is raised in the vitarka mudra, the pose of intellectual argument. The other bodhisattva is a mirror image except that the right hand holds a scroll. Bodhisattvas are Buddhist deities who have foregone entrance into Nirvana until the time when all beings have attained enlightenment.",
