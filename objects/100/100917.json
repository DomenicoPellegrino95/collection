  "text": "This square salad bowl form was commonly made in China for export to the European market in the 1790s.  At about the same time, England introduced protective tariffs on imported porcelain, paving the way for English manufacturers such as Worcester to fill consumer demand by producing their own versions of Chinese export forms.  This in turn forced the Chinese into the American market and led to the ascension of domestic English porcelain.",
