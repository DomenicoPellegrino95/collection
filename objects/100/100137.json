  "text": "In the desert region of Rajasthan, rural and urban women wore essentially the same costume comprising an <I>odhani<I> (veil), <I>kanchli<I> (blouse) and <I>gaghra<I> (skirt). Differences in social rank were emphasized by differences in fabric and decoration. Nothing signaled high status more than the lavish display of gold and silver.   \r\n\r\nThis woman's outfit from a noble Rajasthani family makes use of fine cotton muslin decorated with <I>gota<I>, a gilded silver ribbon. Such fabric was a staple of north Indian royal dress for both men and women. Here, the veil is particularly notable. When draped over head and shoulders, the exuberantly fringed borders became a dazzling halo for the royal face.\r\n",
