  "text": "As one of the important young female Swedish glass designers of the 1960s and 1970s, Eva Englund brought sensitivity to her work, exploring the themes of her generation, like her contemporaries Ann Wolff and Ulrica Hydman-Vallien, whose work is also shown in this exhibition. She worked at Pukeberg Glasbruk from 1964-74, and moved to Orrefors where she developed personal themes in her art glass designs.  She also revived and innovated the graal technique (creating ornamentation within the glass) developed by Edward Hald and others at Orrefors. This early graal vase features nature themes, playing on vulnerability and escapism seen in many of her earlier pieces.",
