  "text": "In the 1950s, Italian glass artists became more adventurous with their techniques; the patchwork method employed in this vase became popular through the work of Fulvio Bianconi for Venini and Anzolo Fuga for AVEM. The technique involves laying down colored and clear glass rods that are then fused together into a plate, which is then formed into a vase. While Bianconi's patchwork vases were composed of small, regular colored, white, and clear squares, Fuga's work, as seen in this vase, has a more dramatic contrast between large sections of opaque white and colored glass--the composition is akin to a modern abstract painting.",
