  "text": "In this imaginary scene, Canaletto visually linked dilapidated modern structures with ancient Roman remains, including a triumphal arch and temple. Overgrown with vines, the large, shadowed arches of the portico frame the luminous view, set near a harbor where ships are moored. A single, forgotten lantern hangs against the white sky. Canaletto's picturesque scene is shaded without cross-hatching, just deceptively simple, quivering lines that amplify the bright, flickering light of an ocean sun.",
