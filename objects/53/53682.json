  "text": "By the 1740s Canaletto was painting fewer pictures, and the war of the Austrian Succession slowed Venetian tourism. He began to explore etching, and Joseph Smith, the English art dealer who lived in Venice, commissioned a series of views on paper comprising both real and imaginary places. These four small etchings, printed on a single sheet, are scenes from the area between San Marco and the waterfront. Canaletto's realistic representations of some of the most ornate and impressive buildings in the political center of Venice gave authenticity to the city's controlled and classical self-image.",
