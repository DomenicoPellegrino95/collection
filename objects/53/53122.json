  "text": "Lino Tagliapietra was born into the art of glassblowing on the Venetian island of Murano. After being apprenticed to Muranese glass master Archimede Seguso and working as a master and designer at other Italian glass studios such as Venini, Tagliapietra was well equipped to make a name for himself in the world of glass. Thanks to the development of the studio glass movement in the United States and beyond, Tagliapietra has found a receptive international audience for teaching and collaboration. Through his skill and far-reaching efforts he is recognized as one of the most eminent glass artists working today. He applies age-old Venetian finesse to large-scale sculptural forms with his pieces such as <I>Hopi<I>. ",
