  "text": "The first female designer for Orrefors when she arrived in 1947, Ingeborg Lundin brought a new lightness to the firm's output. Like Nils Landberg, she designed functional and sculptural wares for Orrefors, concentrating on loose engravings and pure form. Her most memorable and breathtaking creation is the <I>Apple<I> vase, free-blown with its perfectly proportioned stem. It is a classic Scandinavian design from the post-World War II period.",
