  "text": "Edward Hald, a ceramic designer recruited in 1917, was one of Orrefors' earliest and most talented hires. Through his tenure into the late 1970s, he served both as Orrefors' artistic director and managing director, and his achievements were many. He is best known for his refinement of the graal technique first developed by Simon Gate. This graal bowl was produced by taking a clear inner core of glass and overlaying it with a blue layer. The decoration was then etched or cut in to the colored glass, and the whole piece was then heated and overlayed with a layer of clear glass. With the ornamentation incorporated within the walls of the vessels, the object has an ethereal appearance. In 1974, the young designer Eva Englund came to Orrefors and revived the graal technique. One of her graal vases is on view in this gallery.",
