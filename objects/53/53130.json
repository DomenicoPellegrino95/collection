  "text": "Ann Wolff left the commercial glass world in 1978, after designing for Pukeberg Glasbruk from 1960-64 and for Kosta Boda from 1964-79. She set up her own studio and has employed skilled glassblowers; she also has welcomed glass artists from abroad in a collaborative atmosphere. By traveling and lecturing widely in Europe, the U.S., and Japan since the 1970s, she has been an inspiration to many younger glass artists. This impressive, richly-colored platter/bowl with bubble inclusions was made during a time of experimentation with technique for textural effects. It is a departure from her narrative figural designs of the time, which she returned to in the technique of cast glass starting in the 1990s.",
