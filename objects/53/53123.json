  "text": "Dan Dailey is one of the important educators in studio glass, founding the glass program at the Massachusetts College of Art in 1974. A highly accomplished glass master, he has designed for Steuben, Waterford, and other glass firms, and has received numerous architectural commissions. Since the 1970s, Dailey has perfected the art of multimedia glass sculptures with figural components. With <I>The Good Grandees<I>, part of his <I>Circus<I> series begun in 1995, Dailey takes an oversized vase form and attaches meticulously crafted circus characters as \"handles,\" providing a sculptural take on the functional vessel.",
