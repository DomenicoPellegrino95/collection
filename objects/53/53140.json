  "text": "Bertil Vallien is a talented designer who has worked for Kosta Boda glassworks for many years. He has developed a sand-casting technique for the boat forms that he has produced since the late 1970s. Since the beginning, they have explored themes of movement and alluded to Viking ship burials. This piece was specially commissioned by the American Swedish Institute in Minneapolis to commemorate the journeys of Swedes to the United States hoping to find a better life here. The solid clear form near the center is a pod or seed that represents hope, dividing life from an unknown future. The compass and ladder in front of the pod signify direction and opportunity, while the section behind the pod represents the old country left behind.",
