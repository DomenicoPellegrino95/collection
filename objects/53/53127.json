  "text": "Born in Småland, the Swedish province where Orrefors is located, Sven Palmquist seemed destined to have a career at Orrefors. Taken on in 1928, he developed the Kraka and Ravenna techniques, both departures from graal. Ravenna was named for the Byzantine mosaics Palmquist saw on a trip to that Italian city in 1947--illuminated by soft light, he described them as \"not walls but colored air.\" The Ravenna technique involves casing a clear plate in colored overlay, sandblasting out the square, tile-like designs, and filling the empty spaces with colored crushed glass. The piece is then heated, overlaid with a layer of clear glass, and shaped in a mold.",
