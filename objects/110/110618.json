  "text": "Fujino Sachiko is one of a growing group of women artists who have begun to enjoy success in the traditionally male-dominated field of Japanese ceramics. Her works often feature subtly textured and colored surfaces-the result of applying clay slip with an airbrush. This sensitivity to delicate surfaces harkens back to her training as a fashion designer and fabric dyer. ",
