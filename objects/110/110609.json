  "text": "Hamanaka Gesson operates a studio and kiln near the city of Hagi, a pottery making area since the beginning of the 17th century.  Historically, Hagi potters used local pink-orange colored clay that they decorated with a translucent glaze made from feldspar and ash. Although Hamanaka is influenced by this tradition, he also experiments widely, using a variety of clay and glaze materials. For this dramatic platter, for example, he employed a dark, unctuous glaze first championed by the tea master Furuta Oribe (1545-1615). ",
