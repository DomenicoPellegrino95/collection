  "text": "Born and raised in Tokoname, Koie Ryo_ji has fashioned clay his entire life--first as a factory worker and then as an artist.  His approach to clay is visceral and highly expressive, but he produces a full range of objects from non-functional sculptural work to traditional tea wares. For the last decade, he has produced many bell-shaped vessels such as this one. Wide-bottomed and stable, these simple vases serve as \"canvas\" for his seemingly casual application of glazes. Here, a thick, glassy Oribe glaze runs in heavy rivulets down the surface of the form. ",
