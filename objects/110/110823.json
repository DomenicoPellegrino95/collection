  "text": "It is common among the Pueblos that the men do the weaving.  In historical times, this style of woman's manta was worn daily, but this particular manta may have been used for ceremonial purposes because of its elaborate decoration.   The lower embroidered section is divided into five sections, each embellished with a diamond-shaped motif.  Within each diamond are designs that have been embroidered and reference the Hopi worldview of renewal and rejuvenation.  The symbols are flowers, butterflies, and rain clouds.\r\n\r\nThe painted designs on the skirt of the Butterfly Maiden Kachina in this gallery have almost identical imagery.",
