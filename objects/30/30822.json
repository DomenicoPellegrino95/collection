  "text": "During the eighteenth century, Europeans were fascinated with the products imported from the Far and Near East and travel accounts of exotic places that few would actually visit, like China, Japan, and India.  In lieu of actual encounters, people surrounded themselves with porcelain, prints, furniture, textiles, and architectural elements influenced by a medley of Eastern designs.  English ceramics factories like Worcester imitated Chinese ceramics and decorated porcelain with Asian motifs, such as the landscapes and exotic birds seen here, in an effort to compete with a lucrative market.",
