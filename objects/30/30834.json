  "text": "The German artist George Grosz was known for his satirical antiwar and anticapitalist works, especially his searing condemnations of corrupt and decadent Berlin society. Fervently anti-Nazi, Grosz saw the rising specter of fascism and immigrated to America with his family in 1933 just months before Hitler rose to power.\r\n\r\nStreet Fight in Vienna, painted after Grosz moved to New York, was inspired by a short-lived uprising in Austria in 1934 in which several hundred people died in street battles in Vienna and other cities. Grosz’s fractured composition is reminiscent of photomontage, an assemblage technique he developed in the late 1910s with fellow Dada artist John Heartfield.",
