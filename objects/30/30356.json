  "text": "A contemplative scholar sits at ease with his books and writing tools in an outdoor setting. His young assistant prepares the ink as his master looks on perhaps, imagining some future verse. Album leaves such as this typify early Ming taste for Southern Sung models and subject matter.\r\n<P>The influence of the Southern Sung court was maintained by professional Hangchow artists well in to the Ming period.\r\n",
