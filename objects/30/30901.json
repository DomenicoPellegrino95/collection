  "text": "You on one side, a bank teller on the other. That was banking in Owatonna, through a wicket like this, and Sullivan and Elmslie’s aggressive design made it an even more theatrical experience than the mundane banking app on your smartphone. The design was notably artful even in its day: The manufacturer gave an extra cast to the Art Institute of Chicago in 1908. The wicket here is a copy of that museum piece, as the original seven that once adorned teller’s booths were removed in the 1940s and dispersed across the country.",
