  "text": "The last great attempt by Japanese artists to absorb Chinese culture was made by painters of the Nanga school who imitated the brushwork and subject matter of Chinese \"literati\" artists. However, some Japanese Nanga painters were inspired by Chinese painting traditions far removed from the ideals of the scholar-painter.\r\n<P> Kumashiro Yu_hi emulated the style of Shen Nan-p'in, a Chinese academic painter who specialized in bird-and-flower subjects and who visited Japan between 1731 to 1733. This style combined traditional decorative compositions with elements of Western realism, including chiaroscuro. Yu_hi championed Shen's style in Japan and became the earliest proponent of the Nagasaki school which specialized in such bird-and-flower paintings. Here he pictured magpies squabbling on a branch. The \"three joys\" mentioned in the painting's title refers alternately to the three large fruits, probably a species of pomegranate, and to passing the three imperial examinations within China's government bureaucracy.",
