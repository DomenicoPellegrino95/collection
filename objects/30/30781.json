  "text": "Probably carved in the state of Gujarat in west India, this burnished stone image represents one of the twenty-four \"teacher-liberators\" (<I>jinas<I>) of the Jain religion. The figure is meditating, seated cross-legged on an elaborate cushion carved with stylized floral sprays. Though similar to images of the meditating Buddha, the subject is clearly identified as a Jain subject by the quatrefoil medallion (<I>srivatsa<I>) in the center of the chest.\r\n<P>The final goal of a Jain, like a Buddhist or Hindu, is to sever the chain or rebirths and achieve a state of liberation for the soul known as <I>moksha<I> or nirvana. Jainism espoused the cause of nonviolence and taught that the path to enlightenment and liberation was one of asceticism and meditation.\r\n<P>As with Buddhist sculpture, the image is not worshipped as a deity, but honored as a symbol of perfection that points the worshipper toward a spiritual goal.",
