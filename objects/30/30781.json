  "text": "The highly polished surface of this seated, meditative figure is a metaphor for his absolute purity.  He is a Jina, or Tirthankara, a liberated being whose renunciation of passion and anger is intended to guide other individuals towards a life of nonviolence and respect for all living things. In the Jain religion, the world is conceived of as a web of multiple continents and encircling oceans. Devotees can choose to either remain in everyday life, or to practice austerities to free the soul from bondage. ",
