  "text": "As a boy, Philip Barber was fined $25 for writing on the cover of a library book cover. The experience didn't deter him; henceforth he was careful in his selection of material, but remained inexortably drawn to book covers as a canvas.   Salvaged from second-hand shops, Barber adulterates and personalizes covers in a manner that both obscures and reacts to the original. ",
