  "text": "A student of Richard DeVore at Cranbrook Academy of Art, Thom Bohnert creates a unique solution to volume and space.  His assemblages made of ceramic and metal suggest the form of a vessel, but deny this imaginary vessel a utilitarian function.  He claims that he maintains the traditional form because it is universally understood as a containment of space.  These skeletal containers, however, challenge the viewer's perception of traditional space, structure and volume.",
