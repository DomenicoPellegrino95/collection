  "text": "From ancient times, Japanese burned incense <I>(ko)<I> before holy Buddhist images as one of six devotions considered to be effective in accruing religious merit. The diffusion of fragrant smoke symbolizes the permeation of Buddhism throughout the universe. As part of his preparation, a Japanese tea master typically burns incense for the enjoyment of the arriving guests. The incense burner, displayed in the tokonoma alcove, would also be admired by the guests, particularly when a rare, imported example like this one is used.",
