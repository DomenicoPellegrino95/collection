  "text": "This print was originally one of a set of three prints. In each print, a young female attendant accompanies a sumptuously dressed woman who is meant to embody one of Japan's major cities: Osaka (shown here), Kyoto, and Edo. In the case of Osaka, the attendant carries a sake ewer and a cup on a ceremonial serving stand. Her mistress seems to be engrossed in a love letter. Each of the prints also bears a poem that associates a flower or tree with the city. In this example, the poem likens the whitened faces of courtesans to plum blossoms in early springtime:\r\n\r\n<P><I>The setting sun<I>\r\n<P><I>In the first month<I>\r\n<P><I>Brings made-up faces of<I>\r\n<P><I>Plum blossoms.<I>",
