  "text": "Around 1920, Léger turned away from the dynamic mechanical cubism of his earlier paintings to a more ordered, figural style. Looking to art traditions of the past, he gave such time-honored themes as the Three Graces and scenes of odalisques a modern interpretation. In <I>Le Petit Déjeuner (Breakfast)</I> three female nudes are seated by a small table in a domestic interior complete with a dog. Monumental and impersonal, the figures interlock in an anatomical puzzle of interchangeable parts. The emphasis is on pictorial effect and compositional innovation, with strong conflicting perspectives in careful balance. <I>Le Petit Déjeuner</I> is one of two oil studies for the famous <I>Le Grand Déjeuner</I> in the Museum of Modern Art in New York.",
