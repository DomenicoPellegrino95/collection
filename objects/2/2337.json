  "text": "During the Unified Silla period, Buddhism was promoted not only for the salvation of individual worshippers, but for the Korean nation as a whole. Buddhist temples proliferated and bronze images were cast in great number. Small statues like this were created for family altars. While earlier images reflect sculptural styles prevalent in China, the somewhat blocky proportions, stern expression, and simplified drapery pattern of this Buddha are expressly Korean.",
