  "text": "Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein saw the American comic book as a rich source of imagery and inspiration for his own creative practice. Indeed, he freely appropriated published illustrations by other artists, altering their scale, medium, materials, and at times omitting or adding certain compositional details for artistic effect. In so doing, he transformed these unassuming narrative cartoons into compelling works of contemporary art. Though the cropped image and speech bubble of Lichtenstein's Vicki! are removed from their original context, there is sufficient information to suggest any number of melodramatic storylines, the stock-in-trade of comic books of the period.
