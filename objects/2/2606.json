  "text": "Removed from its comic strip context, a single image of a man surprised by a pretty young woman, Vicki: I—I Thought I Heard Your Voice! suggests any number of melodramatic storylines. Lichtenstein was nearly 40 when he produced the first of his signature artworks inspired by comic strips and advertising, methodically reproducing by hand the crisp, bright colors and evenly spaced dots (known as Benday dots) of mass-media printing. The humorous and striking image, left to stand on its own, invites viewers to craft their own narratives for the characters. ",
