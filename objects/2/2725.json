  "text": "Georgia O‘Keeffe produced more than twenty scenes of New York City between 1925 and 1930. Here, the power and presence of the modern era are epitomized in the city’s thrusting architecture. During the first half of the 20th century, skyscrapers came to exemplify U.S. ingenuity. O’Keeffe has reduced these immense buildings to simple geometric forms that converge at the upper reaches of the dark canvas, towering even above the moon. As viewers cramped between architectural giants, we feel small, forced to crane our necks skyward to take it all in. Yet the brightly glowing moon offers a natural contrast to the harsh, tight lines of structures that represent the expansion and encroachment of the city.",
