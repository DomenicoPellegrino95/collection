  "text": "French furniture of the highest quality during the eighteenth century was adorned with gilt bronze or ormolu mounts. Charles Cressent, a leading French cabinetmaker, was especially noted for his elaborate rococo gilt bronze mounts. He trained as a sculptor before turning to cabinetry, and his mounts display a strong three-dimensional organic quality. On this commode or cabinet, the mounts are of acanthus and ivy leaves. Cressent had his furniture mounts chased and gilded in his own workshop, allowing him to maintain quality and inhibit copying by others.",
