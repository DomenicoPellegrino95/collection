  "text": "Shibata Zeshin first trained under the lacquer artist Koma Kansai (1766-1835), but in order to improve his sense of design, he was sent to study painting with Suzuki Nanrei (1775-1844) and Okamoto Toyohiko (1773-1845), both pupils of Maruyama Okyo. As a painter he became famous for his meticulous technique and creative compositions, many rendered in lacquer. In these impressive screens, Zeshin illustrated plants associated with each of the four seasons. Beginning on the left, he depicts a blossoming plum, associated with late winter and the beginning of spring. Dandelions, foxtail ferns, violets and peonies all blossom in later spring and summer. A small <I>hototogisu<I> (cuckoo), whose song is common in spring, perches on a plum branch. The left screen begins with chrysanthemums, pampas grass, and scarlet maple leaves, all emblematic of autumn. Sparrows, a common sight amid fields of ripening grain in autumn, fly above. On the far left, Zeshin depicts masses of narcissus paper whites, associated with winter. The detailed naturalism of these plants clearly indicates his training in the Maruyama School tradition.",
