  "text": "Matsumura Keibun specialized in bird-and-flower paintings. His light, seemingly spontaneous style, belies his considerable skill in handling the brush. Typical of paintings by Shijo_ school artists, Keibun gently introduced elements of Western realism into his works. Here, for example, he depicted taro leaves in various states of unfurling.",
