  "text": "Catherine Coustard came from a family of well-to-do cloth merchants in Paris and married into the Aubrys, wealthy, middle-class civil servants and statesmen from Tours. At the time of this portrait, her father-in-law had just been ennobled after serving twenty years as secretary to the king, thus precipitating the great step upward in family prestige that this picture commemorates.",

  "provenance": "House of Largillierre in 1699.[1] Madame Charles de Dompierre d'Hornoy, Paris, France, by 1928; by descent to her grandson, Guy de Bouteville, Paris, France. (Galerie Cailleux, Paris, France, in 1977); sold to MIA in 1977.\r\n\r\n[1] This has been added to clarify confusion regarding the dating of the portrait. Largilliere appears to have begun this portrait in 1699. In a \"Statement of goods and effects of Nicolas de Largilliere, customary painter to the King and his Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture\", drawn up at the time of the painter's marriage, August 19, 1699 (National Archives, file X 251) there was due to M. de Largilliere: 420 pounds for the portrait of Madame Aubry. On the basis of this inventory, Georges de Lastic thinks the date '170'' which follows the signature should be read 1700.\r\n\r\nAccording to information furnished by Georges de Lastic, the Marquis of Castelnau [1673-1728] was the wife of Charles-Léonor Aubry [1667-1735] who was the Marquis of Castelnau, seigneur of Lazenay, Plotard, and other places in Berry. The Marquise of Castelnau was the daughter of Gabriel Coustard, Counsel to the King and Comptroller General of the Legion of Honor. She is depicted her with her eldest son Léonor Aubry, [1695-1770] later the Marquis of Castelnau. Quite wealthy, the Aubrys owned the magnificent estate of Castelnau near Bourges, on which the chateau stands today. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
