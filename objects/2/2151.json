  "text": "Beginning in the Muromachi period (1392-1573), Japanese tea aficionados admired the Chinese teabowls produced in Fukien Province, known as Chien ware. The Japanese called them <I>temmoku<I> since they associated the bowls with Mt. T'ien-mu, in the neighboring province of Chekiang, where they traveled to study with noted Zen masters. As in this example, the glaze sometimes ran during the firing process, creating a pattern of fine persimmon-colored streaks popularly known as \"hare's fur.\" This basic style of black ware ceramics remained popular in Japan long after it ceased to be produced in China.",
