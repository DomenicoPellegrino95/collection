  "text": "I have been told that beaders will often make a flower symbolic for an event or represent the intended owner's children by beading a flower for each child. In this way, the stem can be seen as the owner's personal time-line or illustrate a shared source of life that unifies the various flower, bud and leaf patterns.\r\n\r\n--Andrea Carlson\r\n\r\n\r\nThe design on this vest shows the evolution of the Woodlands art once new materials were introduced.  Cotton thread and glass beads provided the artist with more flexible materials to work with.  The designs became even more flowing.  The artist had access to bright colors.  The colors used in the design could match the plant that it represented.  Symmetry is created by the use of repeated pattern,  the color of the cloth becomes the background color as the birchbark was used as a background color when porcupine quills were used.\r\n\r\n--Anthony White\r\n",
