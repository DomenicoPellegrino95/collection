  "text": "This cupboard is attributed to Aslak Lie, a Norwegian cabinetmaker who emigrated to the United States in the mid-19th century.  It was made in the Town of Springdale, near Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, although Lie produced stylistically similar works while in Norway.  The decorative motifs, cabinetry, painting, hardware, and calligraphy on this object are also similar to those on examples signed by Lie.  Note the brass keyhole escutcheons cast in the form of American shields.  The cupboard was made to commemorate the marriage of John Eriksen Engesaete to Brithe Grinde, as indicated by the Norwegian inscription which reads, \"John, the son of Erik; Brithe, the daughter of Sjur; Engesaete.  The year 1870.\"",
