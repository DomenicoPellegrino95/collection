  "text": "The dramatic subject of this sculpture fuses a tragic chain of events from the ancient Greek play, <I>Hecuba</I>, by Euripides into one arresting scene. The sculptor Pio Fedi shows a young Greek warrior, Neoptolemos, carrying away Polyxena, the beloved of his late father Achilleus, who lies lifeless on the ground. Neoptolemos raises a sword, with which he is about to stab the young woman to death for revenge. In vain, her mother, Hecuba, implores him to stop. \r\n\r\nFedi created this sculpture as a model for the colossal marble sculpture, <I>Abduction of Polyxena</I> (1856-1866), which was installed in the Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence. Placed amid several very famous Italian sculptures from classical antiquity and the Renaissance, Fediâ€™s sculpture group became instantly famous itself for its drama and technical mastery, having been carved out of a single block of marble. \r\n",
