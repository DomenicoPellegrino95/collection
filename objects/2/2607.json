He often traveled to Venice during the summer where he studied the works of the old masters.\r\n\r\nThe unusual perspective of this composition offers a view of the bronze horses on the porch of the Basilica of San Marco. The upper section of the Clocktower looms in the background over the Piazza San Marco.",
