  "text": "Clay figures known as <I>haniwa<I>, literally clay cylinders, were placed atop burial mounds during Japan's Kofun period (roughly 300 to 650). In spite of early artists' na√Øve approach, these ancient sculptures are often hauntingly expressive. Even in its present fragmentary state, the baleful eyes and small mouth of this head appear sadly pensive. Simply rendered details also offer a window onto Kofun culture; the \"bowler\" hat and round earrings (imitating excavated gold examples) indicate that the figure represents an aristocrat.",
