  "text": "A white sculpture appears to almost be a cube. This symbol of three-dimensionality is the subject of LeWitt’s 122-piece series \"Variations of Incomplete Open Cubes.\" Each sculpture uses different combinations of three to 11 edges, or \"parts,\" that help you finish the piece in your mind. Here you see the third combination of eight parts that imply the form. As a conceptual artist, LeWitt often relies on viewer participation to fill in what isn’t shown: \"The idea becomes the machine that makes the art.\"",
