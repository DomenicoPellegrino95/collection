  "text": "In 1974 Sol LeWitt produced a series of 122 sculptures, entitled <I>Variations of Incomplete Open Cubes<I>. The different combinations of three to eleven edges, or \"parts,\" encourage the viewer to mentally construct a complete cube--for LeWitt, a symbol of three-dimensionality. Here you see the third combination of eight parts that imply a cube.\r\n\r\nAlthough LeWitt rejects the term \"minimalism\" as demeaning to his art, his use of forms pared down to their pure geometric essences links him to the Minimalist movement. LeWitt considers himself a conceptual artist and emphasizes the process of creation, from initial idea to finished work. In his view, \"The idea becomes the machine that makes the art.\"",
