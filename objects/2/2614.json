  "text": "<I>The Arts of Peace</I> is a study for one of two murals originally painted for the Manufactures and Liberal Arts Building at the Chicago World's Fair in 1892-93. Following the Fair, both <I>The Arts of Peace</I> and <The Arts of War</I> were given to the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 1895. Both murals hang in the main reading room of the university's library.\r\n\r\nOriginal documents from the Chicago World's Fair summarize <I>The Arts of Peace</I> mural:   \"Every figure seems bent on acquiring knowledge. Even the mother takes time from the care of her babe and becomes an interested listener to words of wisdom. The student, the philosopher, the sage, the maiden and the youth are all represented as worshipers at the shrine of knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nJulius Garibaldi Melchers, known as Gari, was born in Detroit, Michigan just five years after his family emigrated from Germany.",
