  "text": "The decoration on this ceremonial tripod consists of a continuous graphic pattern of interlaced bands in five separate registers. The frieze under the rim displays abstract bands, which in turn are filled with a meander, or Greek key, pattern. This basic decorative vocabulary, common in Eastern Zhou period (770–256 BCE) bronzes, has yet to be associated with a specific archaeological site. It can, however, be considered a precursor to the more fully developed intertwine motif commonly defined as the “Liyu style.” The term “Liyu style” is, however, misleading, as that category of 6th- to early 5th-century BCE decoration is more accurately associated with the ancient foundry site of Houma in Shanxi province.",
