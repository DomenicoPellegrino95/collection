  "description": "Portrait of a man, half-length, seated, three quarters right in an armchair of yellowish wood, upholstered in red, at a table covered with a red cloth on which are two upright brown leather books - and two lying down - all with red labels. His right hand rests on another similar book; a volume of Seneca, which rests on his lap. A narrow black enameled ring encircles his second finger. His blue eyes are directed to the spectator and his white hair is brushed forward over his forehead and above his ears. He wears a high collared black coat, a white standing collar, and white neckcloth. The background is plain and of grayish-brown tones.",
