  "text": "The twelve Roman emperors were seen as the perfect role models for rulers in the Early Modern period. The present footed bowl, or tazza, is one of twelve, which are now dispersed throughout the world. Since most silver from the Renaissance was molten down in later periods, when it went out of fashion, this is an extremely rare survival. When the twelve tazze were still together in the nineteenth century, the statuettes on top and the lavish scenes on the bowl were mismatched during cleaning. This explains why the present bowl is crowned by the figure of the first emperor, Augustus (63 BCE - 14 CE), whereas the four scenes on the bowl represent episodes from the life of Domitian (51-96 CE).
