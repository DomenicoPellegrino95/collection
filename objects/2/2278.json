  "text": "Saint Anthony, living in complete isolation amongst the ruins of a fortress near the Red Sea, was constantly tormented by demonic visions and temptations. In Tenierâ€™s depiction, these temptations are a crowd of monsters: beaked beasts dressed as pilgrims, a smiling toad, a dwarf riding an animal skeleton, boogeymen, and other absurd creatures that surround the devil. Disguised as a pimp, the devil introduces a woman to the poor Saint, who struggles to focus on his prayers. ",
