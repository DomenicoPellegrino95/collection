  "text": "Training predatory birds for hunting was a pastime of the Japanese aristocracy and is often represented in the paintings they patronized. Master falconers (takajō) received a special rank within samurai hierarchy during the Edo period (1600-1868). In this visual parody, however, Harunobu depicts a falconer as an urban dandy (wakashu) with elegant green jacket, purple-and-pink striped kimono, and red-and-white striped sash.",
