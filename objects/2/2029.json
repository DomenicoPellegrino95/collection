Joseph May of Philadelphia. In a letter from Eastman's wife, Elizabeth Johnson, she suggests that \"Camp Hospital at Gettysburg\" is the original title. \r\n\r\nSet in the original wooden frame and bearing medals from the American Sanitary Commission, this work was exhibited at the National Academy of Design in 1968 under the title <i>The Field Hospital</i>.",
