  "text": "Born in East Prussia, Lovis Corinth spent almost the entirety of his training and career in Munich and Berlin. However, from 1884-87 the artist - who aspired to be a history painter - studied in Paris at the Acad√©mie Julian under the two celebrated artists, Tony Robert-Fleury and Adolphe William Bouguereau. Their teaching focused on life drawing - an approach that was particularly suited to the large figural compositions of history paintings. This life study is one of approximately twenty paintings - mostly nudes - that survive from Corinth's Parisian sojourn.",
