  "text": "Found only in India, <I>bidri<I> describes a metalwork technique wherein objects are cast from an alloy predominately of zinc with small portions of lead, copper, and tin. The surface of the metal is engraved and the designs are inlaid with silver or brass. The final stage is to darken the base surface with ammonium chloride and copper sulfate. This creates a matt black ground against which the silver and brass pattern show off brilliantly.",
