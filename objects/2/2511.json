  "text": "The extraordinary biodiversity of the Amazon and Andes regions of South America and the active trade networks between the regions provided a near endless source of natural subjects for artists. Plants and animals were common Chavin ceramic subjects; artists often abstracted or stylized natural forms to create elegant, tactile vessels. This pattern and form of this highly-textured spiny vessel may have been inspired by fruit such as cherimoya or guanaba.",
