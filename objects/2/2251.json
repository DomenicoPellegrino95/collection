  "text": "Traditionally the separate blocks which make up an album quilt are not made by a single individual. Although we do not know the specific occasion for which this quilt was intended we can surmise from the religious nature of the inscribed verses in many of the squares that it was made by a church group. Typical of these verses is the inscription written by Elizabeth Thomas on March 4, 1844 (Second row from the left, fifth block down).\r\n\r\nFilled with holy emulation\r\nLet us vie with those above.\r\nSweet the theme - a free salvation!\r\nFruit of everlasting love.\r\n\r\nThe women who made this quilt obviously took great pride in not only their sewing skills but in creative use of available materials and techniques as exemplified by the pieced blocks in the lower corners, the many appliquéd English chintz patterns, the stuffed cherries in the laurel wreath (4th row, 5th block) and the sensitive use of fabric on the appliquéd flower groups.  Especially note block 3 in the 3rd row made by \"Mary\".",
