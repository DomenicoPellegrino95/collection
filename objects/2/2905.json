  "text": "This early bowl and teapot are typical of Voulkos's functional wares, at which he became quite adept before continuing to challenge himself by \"deconstructing\" the functional pot.  In fact, while teaching at the University of California at Los Angeles in the 1950s, he and his students would often challenge themselves to throw a complete teapot--with lid, handle, and spout--within a two-minute limit.  The sgraffito fish decoration on the bowl and the Asian-inspired oxide glaze decoration of the teapot reflect the prevalent techniques and influences of this period.",
