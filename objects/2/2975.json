Needlework samplers demonstrated the artistic achievements of students, chief among them being a range of delicate stitch techniques. This sampler records the skills of its ten-year-old maker in handling a dozen embroidery stitches, her abilities working with metallic thread (a challenging medium for the novice), as well as her competence in painting on cloth and applied paper.",
