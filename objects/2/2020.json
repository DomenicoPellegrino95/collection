  "text": "The Taoist immortal Kinko_ is said to have been fond of fish, and to have passed his days making paintings of them. On his 200th birthday, a great carp appeared which took Kinko_ on a sightseeing tour of the waterways. He returned carrying a Buddhist scroll exhorting humankind to refrain from harming fish. Ukiyo-e artists updated the Kinko_ theme by transforming the wizened old sage into a beautiful courtesan.",
