  "text": "Deer held an important place in Moche society; they were the only animal to serve as substitutes for people during sacrificial rituals, and were likely only consumed by the elite. A symbol of elusiveness and agility, deer were frequently shown in scenes of war, often serving as the enemy fighting against the Moche. Here, the arrow-impaled deer is depicted with cream slip on a red clay background.",
