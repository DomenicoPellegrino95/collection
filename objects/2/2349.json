  "text": "China's cultural influence on Korea dates to over two thousand years ago when they first engaged in trade. This influence is seen in Korea's ceramic production, when local potters began making porcelain at the end of the fourteenth century, with many of their wares modeled on Chinese prototypes. This later vase is no exception, as it features a cup-like mouth, which is also seen in Chinese porcelain. The abstract design in blue underglaze is suggestive of flowers, with similar motifs appearing on other Korean wares. ",
