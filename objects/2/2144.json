  "text": "Icarus strains for the sky, his wings poised for takeoff, in this smaller version of a life-size sculpture created for the Paris Salon of 1831. In Greek mythology, Icarus was imprisoned in a labyrinth on the island of Crete, together with his father Daedalus, a master craftsman, who constructed wings of wax and feathers to help them escape. Though his father warned him not to fly too close to the sun, Icarus could not resist the temptation and plunged to his death when his wings melted.",
