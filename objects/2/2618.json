  "text": "Lacquer, which is produced from the sap of the sumac, requires several layers to be built up before it can be carved. By alternating the colors in this lengthy layering process and then carving down to a specific depth, thereby exposing the desired color, artisans were able to create multi-colored scenes in this exacting medium. On the top of this box is the auspicious character for Spring, above a bowl with symbols of wealth and auspicious emblems. This complex motif is found on many other examples of Qianlong period lacquer.",
