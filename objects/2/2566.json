  "text": " This colorful screen illustrates a favorite Japanese seasonal pastime, the viewing of crimson maple leaves in the autumn. Within a curtained enclosure two sumptuously attired women, surrounded by their attendants, are enjoying music and refreshments. They sit before an elegant folding screen, thus demonstrating how these objects were used by the Japanese out-of-doors for privacy and protection against the wind. On the far left, a group of women heat sake (rice wine) over a small fire fueled by maple leaves. A foot soldier announces the arrival of his master, shown in a blue patterned kimono and plaid jacket on the far right. \r\n<p>This work is signed by Miyagawa Choshun, an ukiyo-e artist who specialized in painting rather than woodblock prints. Choshun was renowned for his delicate style and for his ability to depict figures that seem to interact in a natural and convincing manner. \r\n",
