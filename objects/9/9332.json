  "text": "This rare portrait of a literary gathering depicts Dong Qichang (1555-1636), one of the most important personalities in the history of Chinese art, at the far right. Next to him stands his close friend Chen Jiru (1558-1639). To the left of Chen, the scholars Wang Chideng (1535-1612), Zhang Fengyi (1550-1636), and Zhao Huangkuang(1559-1625) are shown playing the <I>qin<I>. The monk Yan Tianchi (17th century) and Chuhong(1535-1615) appear to the left of them. The men are gathered around a large <I>taihu<I> rock to listen to <I>qin<I> music, examine scrolls, and to converse. These historic figures epitomize the literati ideal. They were all trained in Confucian classics, some served the state as scholar officials, and all played the reclusive role of retired gentlemen. They defined Ming literati tastes through their painting, calligraphy, music, writing of poetry, carving seals, and collecting of ancient rubbings.\r\n<P>Sensitive to literati pictorial taste, the painter used muted colors and exhibited a variety of brush strokes and a na√Øve sense of space. The title colophon, composed of five beautifully balanced characters, is signed by Dong himself, the great literatus who created a new artistic and cultural synthesis in the seventeenth century. There are seven attached colophons ranging in date from 1762 to the early twentieth century.",
