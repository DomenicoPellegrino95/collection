  "text": "Made for Buddhist rituals, this finely finished, elegantly proportioned, lidded bottle vase and basin can be associated with the bodhisattva Kuan-yin (Avalokitesvara). Called an ambrosia vase, it is the type carried by Kuan-yin and is said to carry the elixir that comforts mortals who are seeking salvation.\r\n<P>Although the specific use of these utensils in T'ang Buddhist rites is uncertain, the vase is inscribed with the characters <I>ching cheng hao<I> (\"pure, righteous, and good\") and the single character, <I>feng<I>, meaning to \"bestow\" or \"seal up.\" These words suggest that these vessels might have once been sealed up as part of an offering in a dedicatory vault beneath a temple pagoda.\r\n",
