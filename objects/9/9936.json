  "text": "<I>Tropic of Capricorn<I>, with its complex jumble of motifs, has been attributed to two distinct sources in the Larsen literature. The fabric information card from 1964 states, \"The pattern-on-pattern [theme], softened by superb blending of colors, reflects the Moorish influence of North Africa.\" In his book, <I>A Weaver's Memoir<I>, however, Larsen refers to the pattern as \"freely translating the fabric wealth of Nigeria's blue markets…” Merchants of the 'blue markets' specialize in the sale of <I>adire cloth<I>, a traditional indigo resist-dye fabric produced by the Yoruba of Nigeria that features multiple design areas. \r\n\r\nMany sub-Saharan African textiles, particularly those that utilize dye processes or embroidery techniques, display very sophisticated programs of decoration. Often, the cloth is divided into sections based on a grid and different patterns are placed in each square. Similarly, Islamic art and architecture of North Africa emphasize the juxtaposition of multiple patterns and designs within a single work of art. Publicity materials for Larsen's <I>African Collections<I> cite both of these aesthetic forms as sources of inspiration.\r\n",
