  "description": "Droll figure of a man wearing loin cloth breeches, coiled collar, scalloped nose plug, and ear pendants, and carrying a flat percussion instrument on left arm and notched drum stick in right hand. These instruments recall those used in rhumba music. The cheeks of the figure are pierced for a reed, and the figure itself represents one of a group which participated in a game or dance. The workmanship is heavy and primitive, but the bending figure is spirited in expression. Painted decoration badly weathered.",
