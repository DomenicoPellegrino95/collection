  "text": "<I>Crescendo<I> draws its inspiration from several sources.  The curved, s-shaped lines of Brown's pattern references the ogee, an architectural form combining a concave and convex arc.  The term is also related to mathematics, meaning an inflection point, of which can be seen many times in <I>Crescendo<I>.  Additionally, a connection can be made between Brown's textile and the work of Pop artists such as Roy Lichtenstein. Lichtenstein's use of Ben-Day dots gave his works the appearance of comic books or newspaper print.  <I>Crescendo's<I> groupings of regularly spaced circles mimic Ben-Day dots in their indication of the gradation from largely white to largely black areas.",
