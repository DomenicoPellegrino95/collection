  "text": "Pier Leone Ghezzi (1674-1755) a painter and draftsman, popularized caricature as an art form in 18th century Italy with innumerable portraits of dilettanti, Roman artists, and people on the Grand Tour. Ghezzi's style was gently mocking and comical, using simple pen and ink to exaggerate a few select features of his sitters. In this way, he captured an individual's essential character. For a century before Ghezzi Italians had practiced caricature--the word derives from the Italian verb caricare, which means to burden, overload, or exaggerate--yet he was key to its development. He transformed the informal sketches and visual puns produced in artists' workshops in the 17th century into a specialized artistic genre, one that satirized specific individuals rather than societal types. His influence on the genre of caricature cannot be overstated. Extremely prolific, Ghezzi produced thousands of caricature drawings, many of which found their way to England via tourists and collectors. Prints were also produced after his works, further disseminating his manner. ",
