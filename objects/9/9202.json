  "text": "The weak-willed Roman prefect Pontius Pilate attempts to escape having to execute Jesus, whom he believes to be innocent. His plan is to offer the public the choice of granting the annual Passover pardon to this puzzlingly meek figure or to the notorious criminal Barabbas. But, his plan is failing, and he looks overwhelmed by the jeering crowd that continues to cry out for the crucifixion of Jesus.\r\n \r\nIn 1653, dust from repairs to the foundation of his home left Rembrandt unable to paint. Instead he poured his artistic energy into making some of his most spectacular prints, including this one. He chose to work in drypoint—directly scratching into the surface of the plate—because it was not very sensitive to dust and because he could produce rich, velvety lines. The problem with the technique is that the lines wear quickly, a reason that no other artist put the effort into such large, complex drypoints.\r\n\r\nRembrandt took pains to perfect the image. He made a series of small changes. On display here is the fifth iteration. The fine brown pen lines in the crowd may reveal his efforts to adjust the lighting before committing to making yet more changes to the copper printing plate. ",
