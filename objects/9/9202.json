  "text": "Early in his career, Rembrandt produced a large print of this subject with a decidedly more baroque composition (on view nearby). Here he rethought the image to contend with the Renaissance ideas of Raphael and his own countryman, Lucas van Leyden. The composition, given structure by the rectilinear massing of the classical architecture, is calm and stable, except for the jeering crowd. Christ is so sparely depicted that he appears almost as the Holy Ghost. \r\n\r\nRembrandt took pains to perfect the image. The fine brown pen lines in the crowd may reveal his efforts to adjust the lighting before committing to making changes in the copper plate. Eventually, after the harsh judgment meted out to him and Hendrickje, he chose the radical solution of effacing the crowd, causing the viewer to have to choose between Christ and the insurgent Barabbas. \r\n",
