  "text": "This celebrated edition of The Apocalypse unites the stark and dramatic illustrations of Jim Dine and the King James Version of the Book of Revelation. This last book of the Bible details the definitive battle between good and evil that will mark the end of Satan's rule through humankind, followed by a thousand-year reign of Jesus Christ on earth and the final judgment. Written in the first century a.d., the text is commonly attributed to St. John the Divine, who is thought to have composed the prophecy during his exile by the Romans on the Greek island of Patmos. \r\n\r\nDine, the American painter and printmaker who began his career as a Pop artist, contributed 29 original woodcuts to the project. His idiosyncratic interpretation of the biblical prophecy, which relies on non-narrative and abstract motifs, is nonetheless informed by the long tradition of artists illustrating the Apocalypse, from medieval times to the Renaissance to the present day. Dine's use of the centuries-old technique of woodcut also acknowledges the legacy of the sixteenth-century German artist Albrecht Dürer, whose famous woodcut illustrations to the Apocalypse are unparalleled in their creative expression and technical refinement.\r\n",
