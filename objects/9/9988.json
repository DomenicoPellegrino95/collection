In this fabric and the panels to the left and right, we see designers from three different countries, Finland, England and Sweden, with a fascination for developing the possibilities of a bold, dramatic statement using a minimal design repeat, the single flower. The Scandinavian tastes favored contrasting colors combined with a large scale motif to make an impact.",
