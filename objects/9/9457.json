  "text": "A shy bachelor who reportedly dressed like a bank clerk, Edward Henry Potthast clearly reserved his passion for his subjects. This charismatic blue tree, fascinating for his color notations (“deep parts R[aw] umber”), probably dates to Potthast’s days in New York as a magazine illustrator, before he embarked on the beach scenes that made his reputation. His heirs destroyed any sketches they felt were inferior, making this gnarly tree a rare survivor. ",
