  "text": "Toward the end of the 1970s, designers moved away from the bold, dominating designs so popular in the early part of the decade to patterns that were meant to harmonize and integrate with the other elements in the home. Two leading contemporary textile producers, Heal in England and Larsen in the United States, both developed semi-abstracted, large-scale landscape patterns. The color range and use of flower-like forms give this textile an exotic, almost oriental reference. ",
