  "text": "Unquestionably one of the earliest and most important prints in the Jones Collection, Firabet of Rapperswil's woodcut testifies to Herschel V. Jones's collecting acumen. It was part of a group of devotional prints he had the foresight to buy in 1925, at a time when these rare prints still occasionally came onto the market. This Crucifix, one of only two impressions in existence, is the first known print to contain both the name of the artisan and his address-the town of Rapperswil in Switzerland. This scene is unusual for including the symbols of the four Evangelists: John's eagle, Matthew's angel, Luke's ox, and Mark's lion. Praying to this image, then, would have reminded people of Christ's connection to the Gospels.",
