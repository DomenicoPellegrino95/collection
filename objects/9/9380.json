  "text": "The geometric symbols or <I>tocapu</I> encircling the top of this <I>qero</I> indicate it likely belonged to a high ranking member of society. This visual language of geometric emblems communicated information about rank and status. While much is yet to be learned about specific tocapu meanings, they have been found in tunics and objects belonging to elites in the Inka and Wari empires. Like other qeros, this one would have been used for <I>chicha</I>, or maize beer. Since qeros were designed for social drinking, artists placed the most important visual symbols in a place of prominence near the top, so they could be easily seen. ",
