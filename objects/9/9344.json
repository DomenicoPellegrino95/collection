  "text": "From the early fourth century, Korea potters constructed hillside climbing kilns capable of reaching temperatures around 1200 degrees centigrade which yielded durable stoneware. One of the most commonly produced ceramic forms was a  pedestal decorated with pierced, geometric patterns and surmounted with a bowl or jar. Discovered in the excavations of tombs and palaces, these handsome vessels were used both for utilitarian and ceremonial purposes.",
