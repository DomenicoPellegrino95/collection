  "text": "Jacob Cats plucked images from his photographic memory and assembled them into drawings in his Amsterdam studio. Here he depicts the village of Heemstede, parts of which lay in Haarlemmerhout, the oldest public park in Holland. Because the village levied no taxes on beer, innkeepers clustered their taverns there (a fact that may explain the tiny figure relieving himself against a wall, at far left). Even for Cats, one of the best draftsmen 18th-century Holland ever produced, the scrupulous precision of this drawing is a tour de force.  ",
