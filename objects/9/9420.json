  "text": "Cast in the form of a hoofed mythical animal, this container held water for making ink. A finger hole is positioned on the back with the outlet hole located in the mouth. By covering the finger hold, a controlled amount of water could be sprinkled onto the inkstone for the grinding of ink. The creature probably represents a <I>chi-lin<I>, an auspicious mythological animal of good omen whose appearance at the imperial court was a sign of heavenly favor.",
