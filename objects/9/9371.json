  "text": "Made when the artist was just 20 years old, this sheet is the earliest known drawing by the French sculptor Augustin Pajou. Highly finished, it appears to be a fanciful design for an elaborate tomb monument that Pajou may have envisioned for himself one day. He inscribed his name on the sheet no less than three times. \r\n\r\nPajou's drawing style is highly pictorial. This study exhibits a rich range of tones and media - -pen and ink, gray and brown washes, and black, red and white chalks. Somewhat surprising for a sculptor, Pajou's approach to drawing reflects a rigorous academic training, and shows that he studied drawings and prints by painters and sculptors alike. ",
