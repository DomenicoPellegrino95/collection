  "text": "The god Terminus, who was probably of Sabine origin, was the custodian of the borders of the land of the State. He held the stones or markers that delineated the borders between individual properties during the \"terminal\" celebrations on February 23rd. Garlands and cakes were placed upon these stones.\r\n\r\nThe bold, vigorous strokes of the etching needle typify Castiglione's technique.\r\n",
