  "text": "<I>Equilibrium<I>, like many of the other textiles in this show, uses the juxtaposition of rounded and straight lines as the foundation for its patterning.  Fountain's design features bi-colored circles spanning a spectrum of yellow, green, blue and purple.  The circles are arranged on vertical lines, which visually reference the abacus and its mathematical calculations, but the overall triangular effect is similar to supergraphics popular in the 1970s to define architectural spaces and interiors.  Like Barbara Brown's textiles, <I>Equilibrium<I> brings in a wide range of colors for complex screen-printed designs. ",
