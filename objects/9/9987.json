The leafless trees, a harvest moon, and the use of color communicate very specific information without a single word being used.<P>\r\nSome of the dramatic screen prints of the 1960s and 70s create bold statements that can be used as wall art. Prints such as this one can be displayed in a broad horizontal format and used to dominate the rooms in which they are installed.   \r\n",
