  "text": "The sling’s pristine condition, large size, and elaborate construction point suggest a ceremonial function. The cradle of the sling lacks the slit commonly used in utilitarian slings to secure a projectile. Slings were important weapons in tinku battles. Tinku was a form of ritual engagement in which two opposing groups met in a violent battle—becoming one in the process. Such battles were intended to shed blood as an offering to deities and maintain balance between communities.",
