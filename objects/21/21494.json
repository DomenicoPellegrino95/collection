  "text": "What is a particularly German look' Sander tried to find out through an ambitious project he called “Citizens of the Twentieth Century”—500 photographs of his fellow Germans, from peasants to statesmen, including this portrait of painter and architect Peter Abelen's wife, Helene. \r\n \r\nSander believed human physiognomy, or facial characteristics, could help tell one’s profession and psychological state. But this photo says more about women's independence: According to Sander’s grandson, Abelen liked his wife to wear flowing pants and ties, unusual for women at the time.",
