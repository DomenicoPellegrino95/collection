  "text": "This photograph portrays an array of circus performers. The arrangement appears both casual and formal, conveying distinct individuals within the group.  \r\nSander makes no effort to exaggerate the sitters or scene. He preferred a sharp focus to a softly atmospheric lighting style, thereby lending a more straightforward effect. He stated, \"There's nothing I hate more than sugar-glazed photography.\" Sander's grandson, Gerhard Sander, remembers his grandfather's portrait process: \"No artificial light, no timer, and he looked straight into their eyes. He really got the measure of his sitters.\"  \r\nTake a moment to imagine the roles these characters play in the circus. What expressions do you observe, and how does that reflect the sitters' social positions'\r\n \r\n\r\n",
