Scott wrote: \"Some persons have imagined, probably because of Millions of Cats…that Wanda's home was literally swarming with cats. In fact, she seldom had more than one. Her pictures are composite drawings, showing the same cat in many different poses. She liked cats because they relax so completely and so gracefully.\"",
