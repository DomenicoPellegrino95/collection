  "text": "\"Every man was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth.\"\r\n-Miguel de Cervantes, <I>Don Quixote</I>, 1615\r\n\r\nWhen traveling in the Middle Ages and Early Renaissance, it was customary to carry personal eating utensils as well as writing materials. Most letters and documents were sealed with wax.  This spoon's cast knob, or finial, could be used to stamp the owner's mark onto the wax.  The \"AW\" who owned this spoon could have received it as a christening gift and used it throughout his or her life.  Antique seal-top spoons became popular baby gifts again in the late 1800s.",
