  "text": "Tzutes are multi-purpose cloths that are worn as part of Maya everyday dress.  When used for ceremonial occasions, they appear most commonly as a headdress.  This particular style is for men, and was worn with the cloth folded diagonally.  The fold was then placed low on the forehead, with the two ends tied and draped in back.  For certain religious functions, tzutes are removed from the head and placed instead over the shoulders.  The bright red color and rows of birds mark this piece as coming from the Santo Tomas Chichicastenango area.  Each Maya region employs distinct colors and patterns in their textiles, so that, historically, where someone lived could be identified by the appearance of their garments.",
