  "text": "Jiz' descends on a cloud from the heaven of the 33 gods, his feet supported by two lotus flowers. He holds a wish-granting jewel used to save those who dwell throughout the six earthly realms. Though he wears the attire of a monk, he's adorned in gold jewelry and his robes are richly rendered in gold paint and cut-gold leaf (kirikane).",
