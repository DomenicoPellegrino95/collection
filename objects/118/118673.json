  "text": "In Chinese literati culture, the brush, a writing implement, is known as one of the “four treasures of the study” along with the inkstick, inkstone, and paper. Brush handles are commonly constructed from bamboo, but some brushes have handles of sandalwood, jade, carved bone or ivory, and other precious materials as demonstrated by these examples. During late imperial times, artists catered to the tastes of gentlemen collectors and elaborated brushes with motifs derived from folklore, legends, superstitious beliefs as well as religious subjects from Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism.",
