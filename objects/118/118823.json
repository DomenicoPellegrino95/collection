  "text": "For his Hairstyles series, photographer ’Okhai Ojeikere has documented more than a thousand Nigerian women’s hairstyles—at work, in the street, and at more formal occasions. Internationally celebrated in the worlds of fashion photography and social documentary for its focus on Nigerian femininity, the work gives hairstyles their due as artworks in and of themselves—some of them so sculptural they need thread to hold them together. Yet their meaning for the women themselves, as markers of individuality and cultural pride, remains intact.",
