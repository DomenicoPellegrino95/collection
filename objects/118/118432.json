  "text": "Rosetsu’s skillful use of ink wash poignantly evokes a hazy moonlit autumn sky. Reaching toward the sky are curlicues of what may be mist or ocean waves or even obscured mountain cliffs. While studying under Maruyama Ōkyo, whose Monkey Hanging from a Tree is also in this exhibition, Rosetsu developed an eccentric painting style and is highly regarded in Japan today.",
