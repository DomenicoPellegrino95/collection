  "text": "Jiz''s pose, showing him deep in thought, is associated with the cult of Enmei Jiz', or the 'life prolonging' Jiz'. It was believed that worshipping such images of Jiz' would lead to a longer life. \r\nHe's shown being attended to by Seitaka, the red-skinned figure on the left, and Kongara on the right. These two attendants are generally associated with Fud' My'', one of the five wrathful Wisdom Kings, yet may reflect the practice of joint worship of Enmei Jiz' and Fud', as the two were believed to represent the Buddha's ultimate benevolence and ultimate wisdom, respectively.",
