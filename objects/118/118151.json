  "text": "Jizō’s pose, showing him deep in thought, is associated with the cult of Enmei Jizō, or the “life prolonging” Jizō. It was believed that worshipping such images of Jizō would lead to a longer life. \r\nHe’s shown being attended to by Seitaka, the red-skinned figure on the left, and Kongara on the right. These two attendants are generally associated with Fudō Myōō, one of the five wrathful Wisdom Kings, yet may reflect the practice of joint worship of Enmei Jizō and Fudō, as the two were believed to represent the Buddha’s ultimate benevolence and ultimate wisdom, respectively.",
