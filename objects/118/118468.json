  "text": "Derived from the Hindu pantheon, Bishamonten is the leader of the Four Heavenly Kings (shitennō) who preside over the cardinal directions, analogous to Kuvera, the Indian god of wealth and ruler of the Northern sphere. As evil is believed to approach from the north, Bishamonten is considered the most fearsome of the Heavenly Kings, identifiable by his black face, while the protectors of the east, south, and west are depicted with green, white, and red faces, respectively. When depicted alone, he often has a weapon in his right hand and a pagoda in his left, a symbol of Buddha’s teachings.",
