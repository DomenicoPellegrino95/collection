  "text": "In the early 1990s Sekimachi, a groundbreaking fiber artist since the 1970s, began to form paper vessels, emphasizing translucency. She used as her templates the bowls her husband, wood turner Bob Stocksdale, made from exotic woods. Sekimachi’s single paper bowls, such as this one made from repurposed hornet’s nest paper, allow you to see the ephemeral form and material while perhaps imagining the original bowl.  ",
