  "text": "Two crows huddle against the downpour implied by the vertical swathes of ink wash and downturned leaves. Farther up on the branch sits a kite, seemingly unperturbed by the stormy weather. The pairing of kite and crow is a common motif in haikai (comic poetry) and a theme that crops up in other Buson paintings. He is traditionally regarded as one of the greatest Nanga painters, a style derived from Chinese literati painting.",
