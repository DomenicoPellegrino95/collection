  "text": "This muted depiction, a departure from Kiitsu's usual bright and bold painting style, shows Mount Fuji from the shore of Miho-no-matsubara, a pine-covered peninsula that stretches into Suruga Bay and is itself a famous locale. Though the area has inspired many literary and theatrical works, the painting does not seem to allude to any, and may have been sketched from life as the crest of Mount Fuji bears five peaks rather than the traditional three of many renditions.",
