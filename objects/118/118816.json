  "text": "“Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup” is a poem attributed to the Tang dynasty poet Du Fu, which paints a satirical picture of his fellow literati scholars and was a popular subject for Chinese and Japanese artists and calligraphers:\r\nHe Zhizhang rides his horse as though he were on a swaying ship; if bleary-eyed he should tumble down a well, he would lie at the bottom fast asleep.\r\nPrince Ruyang drinks three measures before going to court; If he passes a brewer’s cart along the way, his mouth waters—He regrets only that he is not the Prince of Wine Springs.\r\nThe Minister of the Left spends ten thousand coins daily, and drinks like a whale, imbibing one hundred rivers; holding his wine cup he insists, “I drink as a sage and avoid virtue.”\r\nSongzhi, a handsome youth, is exceedingly refined; turning his gaze to the heavens and grasping his beloved cup, he stands like a tree of jade, swaying lightly in the breeze.\r\nThe ascetic Su Jin meditates before an embroidered image of the Buddha, but he enjoys his lapses when he goes off on a spree\r\nAs for Li Bai, one measure will inspire a hundred poems; he sleeps in the wine-shops of the capital, Chang-an. When summoned by the Emperor, he will not board the Imperial barge; he calls himself “The official who is the god of wine.”\r\nGive three cupfuls to the calligrapher Zhang Xu and his writing becomes inspired—he throws off his cap before the officials and his brush produces cloud and mist.\r\nAfter five measure Jiao Sui is so eloquent, he startles everyone in the feasting hall.",
