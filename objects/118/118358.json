  "text": "Since China’s Tang dynasty (618-907), birds of prey have been used in East Asia to convey various political and social messages. The subject was known in China as qingchao duli, meaning “standing alone in a clean court” or “standing alone in clean tides.” The intention was to encourage courtiers to maintain moral integrity in the face of treachery and corruption. It is unclear whether this bird (probably a White-tailed Sea Eagle) held a specific message for Mochizuki Gyokusen’s contemporaries, for whom birds of prey generally symbolized the power and authority of the military class.",
