  "text": "Birds of prey have been painted to convey various political and social messages since the Tang dynasty (618-907) in China. The subject was known in China as qingchao duli, meaning ‘standing alone in a clean court’ or ‘standing alone in clean tides’. The intention was to encourage courtiers to maintain moral integrity amid a treacherous and corrupt court. It is difficult to ascertain whether the artist of this work intended to impart such a specific message to his audience in Edo-period Japan (1603–1868), where birds of prey generally symbolized the power and authority of the military class.",
