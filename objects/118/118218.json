  "text": "In literati culture, pine, bamboo, and plum are known as the “three friends of winter,” as they offer color in an otherwise lifeless landscape. Among other auspicious connotations, the plants together suggest endurance and faithfulness through adversity. \r\nBaiitsu’s paintings show his familiarity with the Nanpin School, a colorful, detailed mode of birds-and-flowers painting popularized by Chinese painter Shen Nanpin (1682–1758). \r\nIn this pair of screens, decorative qualities are balanced with a sense of order and clarity: the rough bark of the plum tree providing a textural foil to the blossoms; the arching form of the pine mirrored in the flow of the stream. \r\n(2013.30.16.1-.2)",
