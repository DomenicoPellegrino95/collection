  "text": "The two smaller masks, called plank masks, represent stylized birds. Certain designs on the larger one symbolize knowledge that the young male and female initiates learn during their training: the double zigzag line on the front represents the path of the ancestors and the checkerboard on the back refers to the mutual reliance between elders and youngsters.\r\nThe smallest mask, which personifies a bush spirit, achieves an extraordinary level of abstraction and sculptural inventiveness. One scholar likened it to “a fugue founded on a bird call.”",
