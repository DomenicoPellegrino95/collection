  "text": "“Thanking Imperial Advisor Meng for the Fresh Tea He Has Sent Me”\r\n \r\nThe sun seemed fifteen feet above me, and I had fallen asleep\r\nWhen an army officer knocked at the door, waking this Duke of Chou.\r\nHe tells me the Advisor has sent me a letter\r\nOn white silk with slanting fold and three official seals.\r\nI open the missive—it is as if the Advisor and I are fact to face—\r\nAnd inspect by hand the Moon Brick tea, three hundred pieces of it.\r\nI have heard that early in the year, if one goes up in the mountains,\r\nHibernating creatures are beginning to move and spring winds are starting to blow.\r\nThe Son of Heaven, desiring men to taste fine Yangxian tea,\r\nAll other plants never dare to blossom first.\r\nA gentle breeze secretly forms buds like pearls; \r\nBefore spring actually arrives, they put forth sprouts of yellow gold.\r\nThe fresh plants are gathered, the fragrant tea is fire-dried and pressed into bricks,\r\nThe very best, the most exquisite—no empty luxury.\r\nAside from the Most Honored, it is suitable for princes and dukes;\r\nSo how is it that now it has arrived at the home of a mountain man'\r\nMy bramble gate closed tight against vulgar visitors,\r\nWearing a cap of gauze, by myself I boil and taste the tea.\r\nThe blue smoke cloud, drawn by the wind, remains unbroken;\r\nA white froth—floating luster—congeals in the bowl.\r\nWith bowl number one, my throat and lips are moistened;\r\nWith bowl number two, my lonely sadness is dispelled.\r\nBowl number three cleans out my withered bowels,\r\nLeaving only five thousand volumes inside!\r\nWith bowl number four, I raise a light sweat\r\nAnd all the worrisome affairs of my entire life evaporate through the pores.\r\nWith bowl number five, my skin and bones are purified;\r\nWith bowl number six, I commune with immortal spirits.\r\nBowl number seven I can barely get down;\r\nI only feel pure wind blowing, swishing beneath my arms!\r\nThe mountains of the Penglai paradise, where can they be found'\r\nThe Master of Jade Stream want to mount this pure wind and go there now.\r\nThe myriad immortals on these ",
