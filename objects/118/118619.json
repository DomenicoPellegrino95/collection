  "text": "Mary Cassatt began exhibiting with the French Impressionists in 1879, focusing much of her efforts on intimate portrayals of women and children. In addition to her sumptuous paintings and pastels, she became a highly accomplished printmaker, inspired largely by Japanese woodblock prints. The Bath is one of the artist’s most original and technically innovative works.\r\n",
