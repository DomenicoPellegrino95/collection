  "text": "“An Autumn View from a Boat on the Ki River”\r\nThe waves enfold their pure white silk, the wild geese come down in pairs,\r\nHere in the boat of Li and Duo, wine now fills our jars.\r\nGulls and egrets already have forgotten the seaside visitors;\r\nAs for perch, what need to go to River Wu'\r\nThrough evening bell and drizzling rain, the travelers strive to cross;\r\nRed smartweed and white duckweed fill autumn stepping-stones.\r\nFishermen’s flutes waft on the wind—the tunes play without cease;\r\nOn view of sandbanks and new-risen moon, we open cabin windows!",
