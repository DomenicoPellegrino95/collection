  "text": "In an unusually detailed way, but without losing any of their decorative effects, two peonies are captured, being blown violently in a summer rain storm. The waving diagonals of clouds in the background suggest that storm clouds are moving quickly across the sky.\r\nSakai Hōitsu was not only a painter, but also a poet and man of letters. He came from a high-level samurai family, but chose to enter priesthood at the age of thirty-six rather than following a political career. Hōitsu enjoyed a very good education and trained himself in the styles of Chinese masters and ukiyo-e painters. After 1797, however, he devoted himself solely to the Rinpa school with the aim of reviving the style of Kōrin. Kōrin had worked for the Sakai family five generations before, which gave Hōitsu the opportunity to study his works in depth. Hōitsu was truly devoted to Kōrin, but did not simply copy his style, instead he perfected it by combining it with techniques from other contemporary painting schools.",
