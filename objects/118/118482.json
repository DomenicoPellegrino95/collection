  "text": "This scroll depicts the historical Buddha, Shaka, surrounded by 16 rakan. The rakan were the historical Buddha's original 10 disciples, to whom he would preach on Vulture Peak, the backdrop of this painting. Representations such as this, in which the head of a vulture is depicted from a full frontal angle, are rare. The rakan were given supernatural powers and an extended lifespan in order to carry on Buddha's Law, the Dharma, until the arrival of the future Buddha, Miroku. In Chinese tradition, the number of rakan was extended to 16, a convention that transferred to Japan along with the iconography that developed around these disciples.",
