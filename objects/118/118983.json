Based on Ichikawa Chu_sha VII (1860-1936) as Kiichi Hōgen in the scene Imadegawa Kikubatake of the play Kiichi Ho_gen sanryaku no maki (Kiichi Ho_gen’s Three-volume Book of Tactics), performed at the Hongo_ Theater, November 1924.\r\nKiichi Ho_gen is an elderly strategist who is in the possession of an important book on strategy that he tries to safe keep. As this print does not have a publisher's seal and the paper is larger than that used consistently fur Shunsen’s commercial actor prints, it would seem to have been a special edition, probably commissioned by the fan club of the actor and not meant for commercial sale.",
