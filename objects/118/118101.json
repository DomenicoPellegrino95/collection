  "text": "“Floating Island” (Ukishima) was submitted to the 37th Exhibition of Japanese Traditional Art Crafts from the Kinki Area (Nihon dentō kōgei Kinki ten). It was produced within one month using a challenging new technique and is the first of its kind. For the upper rim and mouth, the vertical strips were sharply bent over a core of thicker madake bamboo. Although bamboo is relatively flexible, this degree of curvature can only be accomplished with great difficulty. \r\nThis work showcases the beauty of regular hōbichiku bamboo and is different from Tanioka Shigeo’s usual works which are concerned with creating a sense of flow. The title “Floating Island” refers to its neat and quiet curves that reminded the artist of the tranquility of an island floating on a lake.",
