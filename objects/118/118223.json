  "text": "This humorous pair of scrolls shows the gods of wind and thunder being ambushed by worldly creatures. On the left, the Wind God, identifiable by the deflated wind-producing bag at his side, has been captured by a swooping hawk. On the right, the Thunder God has abandoned the drums he uses to produce the sound of thunder while attempting to escape the pincers of a crab. \r\nThis lively theme was popular with the Kan' painting school during the Edo period, so the fact that Eikai, who studied under literati painter Tani Bunch', took on this subject is rather exceptional.\r\n(2013.30.19.1-.2)",
