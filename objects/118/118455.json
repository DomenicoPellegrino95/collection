  "text": "This pair of screens was inspired by a masterpiece in the collection of Hikone Castle in Shiga prefecture, popularly known as the Hikone Screen and an example of early 18th-century genre painting that depicts the era's customs and manners. Fashionable youth in a pleasure quarter enjoy pursuits symbolic of the four elegant accomplishments of Chinese scholars: music, Chinese chess (go), calligraphy, and painting. \r\nZeshin is primarily known for his artistic innovations in lacquer, yet he was also a painter and this is his greatest masterwork. He created at least six paintings modeled after the Hikone Screen. This is the earliest and most lavish. \r\n(2013.31.47.1-.2)",
