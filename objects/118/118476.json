  "text": "Animals, real and imaginary, are an enduring theme of Japanese art, drawing significance from religious, literary and folkloric sources, and their relationships with humans as pets, livestock, and chance cohabitants. They are often represented in relation to their roles in East Asian cosmology, within which they designate the points of the compass and the months of the zodiac calendar. They may embody human attributes, and lend themselves to poignancy, reverence, humor, and satire. Animals provide ink painters of a diversity of styles and schools with compelling subject matter though which to exercise their skills; the following collection of images is thus a richly varied field upon which to observe the range of ink painting.\r\n\r\nThe tiger is one of the most richly symbolic subjects of East Asian art. It is among the twelve animals of the zodiac, and appears in reference to Daoist, Buddhist, and folk legend, often paired with other symbolic subjects such as bamboo or dragons. Saeki Gantai’s screens feature a pair of white tigers, thought to be the most noble of their kind and particularly auspicious. The tiger on the left screen frolics beside a waterfall, while a second tiger watches from the right, curiously gnawing on a pine tree. Gantai was the son and successor of Saeki Ganku (1749/56–1838), the founder of the <I>Kishi</I> school, which is known for its vigorous depictions of animals, particularly tigers. Here, rough and energetic brushstrokes bring his subjects to life.",
