  "text": "“Stretch” (Tsuranaru), one of Chikuunsai III’s signature works, is made with a plaiting technique which is literally called “true fence” (magaki-ami). In this technique, space is left between the parallel vertical elements, emphasizing the delicate beauty of the bamboo. When viewed from different angles, the light shining through the spacious weaving creates an attractive play of light and shadow.\r\nA similar work is illustrated in Coffland, Robert T. The Tanabe Lineage: Four Generations. Santa Fe, NM: TAI Gallery, 2009, p. 26–27.",
