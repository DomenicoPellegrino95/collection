  "text": "This pair of screens presents two different aspects of a hawk. The scene opens on the right screen with a female hawk joining a male hawk, while the left one catches the male at the very moment of the attack on its prey. The combination of pine trees and hawks (matsutaka-zu), which symbolized fighting prowess, was a favorite subject of warrior-patrons from the 15th century on. Representations of hawks in pine trees painted on large screens or panels made impressive backdrops in main reception rooms.\r\nThe Soga school claims as its origin the ink painters of the Muromachi period, but was actually established by the Momoyama period-painter, Soga Chokuan (1596–1610), father of Soga Nichokuan. The painters of this school were rather conventional Chinese-style ink painters who specialized in the painting of birds, especially eagles and hawks (shichōzu), often placed in a wild setting.",
