  "text": "Cranes, waves, and pines signify long life and evoke the realm of the immortals, the Daoist paradise Mount H'rai (Penglai). Cranes also denote happiness and marital fidelity.\r\nSh'haku was celebrated for the eccentricity of both his lifestyle and painting style. Little is known about his life, but it seems that he was born into a merchant family in Kyoto and received some instruction in Kan' school painting. Taking up the life of an itinerant painter, he created many of his unorthodox works of art for temples, where he lodged while travelling the country.\r\n(2013.30.14.1-.2)",
