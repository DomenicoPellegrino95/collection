  "text": "This work is comprised of three woodblock printed albums, each containing 20 double-page compositions, including popular Rinpa motifs such as deer among pine trees, waves, and the Eight Folded Bridge. Though the albums are intended as printed art rather than a book of patterns, a number of the designs reappear on three-dimensional works such as trays and lacquer boxes, as well as in Sekka’s later paintings. While deeply rooted in the traditions of Japanese art, Sekka was a visionary transitional figure between those forms and modern design and production.\r\n(2013.3.26.1-.3)",
