  "text": "This is the tallest single object that Fukami has created. Through this large, abstract, ceramic sculpture, Fukami intended to overturn the traditional perception of ceramics as relatively small and merely utilitarian or decorative. It took him two years to make this piece, an ordeal that culminated in a heart attack. Using a mould, he made two other Rise sculptures; one is in a private collection in Japan, the other is at the Museum of Ceramic Art in Hyōgo.",
