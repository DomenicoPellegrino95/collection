  "text": "This particular crescent-shaped flower basket was created during his time in Portland. An opening in the center provides space for a small, metal otoshi (interior vase). The vibrant, irregularly woven sculpture is made of hōbichiku, smoked bamboo from old farmhouses, and covered with several layers of lacquer. Yonezawa has made similarly shaped works following the same concept which are intended to be mounted on a wall.",
