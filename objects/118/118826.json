  "text": "Zhong Kui, a historical figure of the Tang dynasty, is the demon-queller according to Chinese legend. After his death he vowed to rid the world of mischievous demons, and was reputedly able to command 80,000 demons. Zhong Kui’s image as a guardian spirit is often painted on household gates, as well as in places of business where high-value goods are involved. Paintings of Zhang Kui cover a variety of themes, and this painting represents one of the most popular genres. Here, Zhong Kui rides in a sedan chair carried by three demons and protected from the sun by an umbrella, which also asserts his high status and extraordinary powers. On either side of the stream he is crossing rise tall pines silhouetted against clouds which separate the foreground scene from the tall mountains in the distance. ",
