  "text": "William Edmondson’s work was immediately valued by its first admirers and collectors within the context of European and American modernism. In 1937, he was the first African American sculptor to be awarded a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. A self-taught sculptor with no formal training, Edmondson took inspiration for much of his subject matter from the black burial art of Tennessee (such as angels and the crucified Christ). Ram, recently acquired in December 2013, is among his most characteristic works.",
