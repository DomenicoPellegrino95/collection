  "text": "William Edmondson was the first African American artist to be honoured with a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1937. Due to its multiple analogies with modernist sculptures by  Amedeo Modigliani and Sir Jacob Epstein, the works of this self-taught artist from Tennessee were much sought after since his lifetime. The subject of the ram was most immediately inspired by Southern burial art. It references the deep religious significance of the ram in many world cultures – such as Abraham’s ram, the ram carried by the Greek god Hermes and Jesus as the Good Sheperd, who is traditionally often shown carrying a ram.",
