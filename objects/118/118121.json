  "text": "The right-hand image in Chikuto_’s sketchbook, with stacked mountains rendered in Mi dots and a sedge coat-clad figure, is one of several early variations of the scene depicted in the previous hanging scroll. The quadrangular rocks in the sketch on the left are a characteristic identified with the paintings of the Yuan dynasty master Ni Zan (1301–1374), and a common feature in the work of artists following his style. The title of this work appears to be a later addition, as it is written on the book’s cover in a hand that does not appear to be the artist’s, who was by no means an ‘old man’ when he filled its pages. As well as painting, Chikuto_ wrote on music, poetry, and art.\r\nInscription\r\n<I>Fallen leaves, cold spring</I>",
