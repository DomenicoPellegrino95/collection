  "text": "Over the centuries, wind and waves have formed the rocks of Matsushima into spectacular shapes. In the upper right hand corner is Zaimoku Island with its impressive stone arch that used to be one of the most famous sightseeing spots in Matsushima until the arch collapsed during an earthquake in 1969. Tani Bunchō, one of the most prolific painters in Edo art circles, traveled to Matsushima at least four times. Bunchō uses the “blue-and-green-style,” reminiscent of Chinese painting during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), to render the pine islands. ",
