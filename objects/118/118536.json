  "text": "This dollhouse originally belonged to St. Paul native Mary Griggs Burke (1916-2012).  It was a gift to Mary from her mother, Mary Livingston Griggs (1876-1967). The large house has electric lighting and running water in the kitchen and bathroom. With its high Palladian windows, the dollhouse may have been based on the Italianate style of the Burbank-Livingston-Griggs House on St. Paul’s Summit Avenue. Each room showcases figurines, miniature furniture, and household accoutrements that Mary and her mother collected over the course of several decades. This early experience of searching for miniature objects in the shops in St. Paul and during family travels may have encouraged Mary’s enthusiasm for collecting later in her life. She eventually became a tireless art collector, amassing one of the world’s greatest collections of Japanese art. ",
