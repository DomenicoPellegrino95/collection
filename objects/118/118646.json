  "text": "Mark Taylor’s Box Set is an ingenious blend of personal history and trompe l’oeil deception. For this project, Taylor scanned the covers of album sleeves selected from his own LP record collection and then stripped them of their original texts and pictures using a graphics software program. He intentionally retained the distinctive wear patterns that had formed on the sleeves from years of use. He then enlarged the scanned images and refitted them with alternative graphics and fictional song titles and liner notes that he carefully compiled in notebooks over many years. The result is an abridged form of storytelling articulated through the organizational scheme of the record album.\r\n            Taylor describes his approach as excavating the past for meaning: “I rob from the graveyard of pop culture and splice together new creations….that feed off the history of cherished objects. I excavate, reuse and reanimate pop artifacts in service of a personal narrative. Set inside an increasingly virtual, digital universe cluttered with the remains of material culture, my work explores how possessions can also possess.”",
