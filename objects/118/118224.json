  "text": "This scroll captures the “three whites” (sanpaku), a popular painting scheme of depicting three white elements, such as snow, plum blossoms, or birds. In this case, a white egret is pursued by a white hawk against a wintery background, hawking being a pastime of nobles and often represented in the paintings they patronized. Ohara Keizan worked in Nagasaki, the only place where foreigners were allowed in Japan during the Edo period. Around 1700, Keizan was appointed “inspector of Chinese art” (kara-e mekiki), a position reflecting his extensive knowledge of this field, and this painting shows the influence of the Northern Song academy style, represented by a highly colored and naturalistic mode of rendering bird-and-flower subjects.",
