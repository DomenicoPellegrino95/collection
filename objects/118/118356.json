  "text": "Uematsu carefully looped and wove the bamboo and rattan strips using techniques learned from years of crafting traditional bamboo flower baskets. The subtle design formed by the two tones of bamboo strips calls to mind the iridescent pattern on a butterfly’s wings. The Clark collections are the world’s preeminent repository of works by Uematsu, who in recent years has distinguished himself with large-scale sculptures like this.",
