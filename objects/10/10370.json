In this rather somber use of color the viewer can easily imagine a cold blustery November day where the last leaves of the year have fallen on a gray cobble stone path.  Consider, though, if you were looking at a cheery green toned version of this same pattern; wouldn't you be tempted to see an ivy covered wall proclaiming the joy of Spring'",
