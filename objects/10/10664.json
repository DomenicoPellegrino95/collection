  "text": "Rodchenko captured an unusual and monumental view of a radio transmission tower—from below, looking up through rings of concentric circles. These hyperboloid structures were marvels of modern Russia, created for Russian radio in the 1920s. Rodchenko’s focus on the manmade infrastructure of modern communication reflected the objectives of the Russian avant-garde, with its focus on geometry and industrial materials. Rodchenko himself was fascinated by radios and had a table full of them in the studio he shared with his wife.",
