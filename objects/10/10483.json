  "text": "This life-sized portrait depicts a prince. He is shown clad in his symbolic dragon gown, formally seated on a red lacquer throne in front of an imperial nine-dragon screen. Virtually every element in this painting symbolically represents Prince Duo-lo's position within the Imperial hierarchy of the Chinese court. Portraits of this scale, painted in exceptional detail with the finest mineral pigments on the most expensive silk, typically were hung in the great halls of the Forbidden City, the Imperial Palace in Beijing. The largest group of such portraits remains in the imperial collection itself, now in Taiwan.",
