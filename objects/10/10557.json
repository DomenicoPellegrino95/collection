  "text": "Some individuals flee into nature on account of broken hearts.  Such is the tragic tale of the two lovers, Majnun and Leila, a Persian story adapted into the Mughal painting tradition.  When Leila’s parents reject Majnun’s marriage proposal, he retreats into the desert, where he lives on the brink of starvation.  Even in his melancholy, the ecstasy of Majnun’s love moves the forest animals, which congregate around him and attempt to nurse him back to health with their milk.   ",
