  "text": "Frame: Gift of the Douglas and Mary Olson Frame Acquisition Fund\r\n\r\n\r\nThis frame is a contemporary late nineteenth-century version of a NeoClassical style, which combines the traditional elements of sanded frieze and bound laurel torus with a radically modernised profile. The choice of this frame for Morisot's work picks up her painterly technique in the sanding of the frieze, while the close framing of the composition by the laurel torus at the sight edge focuses attention on the intimate domestic qualities of the scene.",
