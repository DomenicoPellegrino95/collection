Bradstreet remodeled his rooms according to his own taste for the exotic, and Volk depicts him seated among turkeywork carpets and Moorish-inspired architectural elements and furniture.\r\nRecent conservation of this picture was made possible by a generous contribution from Paula Vesely through the Adopt-a-Painting program.",
