  "text": "After the family of Lan Ying (1585-1664), Chang-Ku (active 1644-1669) and his son, Chang Sheng, were arguably the most important family of professional painters working in Hang-chou during the seventeenth century. Chang Sheng was a conservative artist who continued the Five Dynasties and Sung tradition of monumental landscape painting. The present work was completed in 1670 early in Chang's period of maturity as an artist. Painted in a pavilion on Mount P'ing, above the city of Hang-chou, the mountains show the vertical rock massing angular forms and foreground trees associated with the earlier painter, Ch'ing Hao (10th century) but with a loosened style of decorative brushwork that is in keeping with seventeenth century aristocratic taste.\r\n",
