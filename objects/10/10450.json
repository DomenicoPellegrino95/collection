  "text": "By 1643, the date of this still-life, Pieter Claesz. had been experimenting with the subject for twenty years. Many of these objects, the flute glass and goblet, porcelain dish, watch, lobster, crab, and lemons were expensive items, ostentatious signs of wealth, which the Dutch enjoyed displaying in their homes. Such recollections of exotic food and material possessions were a reminder of the good things in life; however, the presence of the watch reminds the viewer of the transience of these pleasures. Bread and wine introduce an element of religious symbolism and echo the moralizing vanitas (or \"vanity\") still-life painting. ",
