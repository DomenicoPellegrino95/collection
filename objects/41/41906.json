  "text": "Counterproofs are made by placing a clean sheet of paper on a freshly printed impression of a print and running them through the press. The wet ink from the fresh impression offsets onto the clean paper, resulting in a print oriented in the same direction as the image on the printing plate.\r\n \r\nCounterproofs are useful working tools because corrections sketched on them are more easily repeated on the printing plate. In this case, Rembrandt made no changes in the plate. He may not have intended to. About fifteen years earlier in his career, he began making extra copies of unfinished prints so that collectors could see his work in progress. This rare counterproof may also have been made as a special souvenir for a collector.",
