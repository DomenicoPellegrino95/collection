  "text": "Popular quotes from the <I>Qura'n<I>, the Islamic holy book which is the equivalent to the Christian <I>Bible<I>, are embroidered in elaborate metal thread techniques. These inspirational panels are often hung in private homes. \u000bAssociated with the revelation of the word of God in the Qura'n, Arabic calligraphy has been considered the highest of art forms in Islamic cultures. Because of its association with Mohammed, the prophet of God, its importance is its presence rather than its legibility, which allows for considerable artistic freedom. The calligraphy in this piece is enclosed by the form of a traditional Islamic mosque lamp.",
