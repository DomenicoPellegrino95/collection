  "text": "One of Hiroshige's most acclaimed designs, this print depicts a snow scene at Kanbara station on the Tøkaidø Road. Specialists have determined that the earliest editions of the print have a dark gray gradation along the composition's upper edge. This version, however, with the gradation above the mountain ridge and over the rooftops is thought to be from a later edition. Nonetheless, the delicacy of the pale gray shading in the foreground suggests that the printer still took considerable care in its production. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
