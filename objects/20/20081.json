  "text": "Both of these prints depict the famous actor Ichikawa Danjūrō V (1741-1806). Although shown portraying different theatrical roles, he is readily recognizable by his prominent nose and strong presence. In the print on the right, he plays Ōboshi Yuranosuke, the leader of forty-seven samurai who were determined to avenge the death of their lord in the play Kanadehon chūshingura. Shunshō's print shows him with a clenched jaw, suggesting his unshakable determination to carry out the vendetta. \r\n\r\nShun'ei's depiction of Danjūrō V (left) shows him in an unusual costume with dark, bumpy skin, and claws for toes and fingers, suggesting a supernatural transformation. While the play is not clearly identified, Danjūrō's glowering expression indicates the ferociousness he brought to the role.  \r\n",
