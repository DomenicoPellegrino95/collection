  "text": "Trained as a painter, Shibata Zeshin also received critical acclaim for his lacquer designs. He championed a technique of painting with lacquer on paper and silk, a difficult process but one that gives an appealing luster to his renderings. Each of the six leaves of this album shows his masterly use of this unusual medium. This leaf illustrates a spray of maple leaves and a cricket finding shelter in a carrying cloth--subjects that suggest the coming of autumn. ",
