  "description": "Romanesque relief-carved stone Calvary group showing Christ on the cross between standing figures of the Virgin Mary on the left and St. John the Evangelist on the right; Christ appears with a perizonium around his waist, his legs buckling to the left and his head raised but with heavy eyelids; Mary's hair is covered by a simple veil which encloses her left elbow and is held in her right hand, looking down, with her left hand raised to her face; Mary's mantle clings to her legs in a series of \"damp fold\" drapery swirls, and ruffles over her pointed shoes; John holds a book in the crook of his left arm, and with his right hand (fingers now missing) gestures up towards the body of Christ; John's bare feet protrude from under a long garment with a crinkled neckline; just visible above the surviving section of the patibulum of the cross are two small, rounded shapes that most likely formed the tips of a wing, presumably of an angel; five metal pins at top of lower portion for secure installation of heads of John and Mary and torso and head of Christ",
