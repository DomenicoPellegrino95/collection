  "text": "In the 33-print series the Tauromaquia, Goya traces the history of bullfighting in Spain, from men hunting in open fields, as seen in Otro modo de cazar á pie (Another Way of Hunting on Foot), to the modern, ritualized spectacle it became in the 18th century. Goya captures the brut nature of the bull, whose mournful expression shows defeat as he struggles submissively to lift his head. The print is technically sophisticated in its combination of etching, drypoint, engraving, and the new medium of aquatint, which Goya deployed to luminous, evocative effect.",
