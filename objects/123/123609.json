  "text": "Hyperrealist American artist Robert Cottingham favors subjects from daily life, often focusing on commercial signage and advertising left over from the 1940s and 1950s. His work shares some affinities with Pop art, with its emphasis on the familiar and ordinary facets of American life. Similarly his style places more emphasis on stylization rather than exacting Realism. From a distance Ice, a cropped image of vending machine, appears almost photographic. Upon close inspection, however, the composition becomes a surface of etched patterns, and the letters and shadows become abstract shapes.",
