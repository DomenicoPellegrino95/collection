The appearance of Portuguese, Spanish, and Dutch explorers, missionaries, and merchants in Japan in the mid-16th century had a significant impact on the arts. Foreign subjects became popular motifs and depictions of tall foreigners in exotic cloths can be found in paintings as well as on lacquer well into the second half of the 17th century.",
