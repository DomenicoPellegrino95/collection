  "text": "Celebrated for his depictions of monkeys, Mori Sosen also excelled at capturing the character of other animals that were based on life studies. This painting is a precise, sensitive, and slightly threatening depiction of a group of three raccoon dogs (tanuki). The artist combines sharp and strong brushstrokes with soft and weak ones to capture a three-dimensional sense of the true nature of the animals’ fur that appears almost soft enough to stroke. The naturalistic posing, one scratching itself, seemingly listening, one directly staring at the viewer and the third open mouthed, with its tongue extended, illuminates the personal observations of these wild animals. This may be an interpretation of the Chinese proverb typically illustrating monkeys gesturing “Hear no evil, see no evil, and speak no evil.”",
