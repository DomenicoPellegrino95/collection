  "text": "The ceramic artist Kamoda Shōji is widely considered to have transformed the aesthetic appreciation of modern ceramics in Japan. During his remarkable career he was continuously involved in research and experimentation, creating striking works that were only nominally functional, but that displayed fresh and imaginative forms and unique surface decoration. Here, he adorned the rough clay of this upright vessel with abstract patterns of crisp blue-and-white glaze.",
