  "text": "John Wilson’s sympathetic portrayal of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. is directly related to one of Wilson’s most important sculptural commissions, won in 1985 as part of a national competition to create a memorial statute of the civil rights leader for the United States Capitol Rotunda in Washington, D.C. As he had done in the sculpture, Wilson captures King’s physical attributes and inner spirit in equal measures, presenting a countenance of solemn contemplation while allowing a certain vulnerability to appear. \r\n\r\nRendered nearly life-size, King appears almost weary, as if struggling with the psychological and spiritual burdens of his prominent role in the fight for equal rights. At the same time, the portrait’s scale and formal structure lend the work an underlying sense of strength and solidity. Wilson also alludes to King’s death at the hands of an assassin, inserting a cruciform of intersecting lines into the image. Though not overt, the crossing of the horizon line with the vertical line of King’s suit jacket symbolizes the crosshairs of a rifle’s scope and the wooden cross of Christ’s crucifixion. Like Jesus, King sacrificed his life for a higher moral cause. Together, these salient features present King, who was one of the most esteemed public figures of the 20th-century, as both a man and a national hero.",
