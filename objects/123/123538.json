  "text": "Rico Lebrun’s Veteran is one of a number of similarly-themed lithographs he produced at the close of World War II in reaction to the brutality and incalculable human and social cost of modern warfare. Lebrun, a veteran of the Italian armed forces during the 1910s, was staunchly anti-war and was horrified by the widespread destruction left in the wake of violent conflict. Here, he conveys these sentiments through a poignant portrayal of an anonymous, battered veteran whose gaze of despair and mangled body signify the sacrifice he made for country and cause.",
