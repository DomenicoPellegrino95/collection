  "text": "Pipes and cigars, less popular today, were a standard part of most social gatherings, from cocktail parties to jazz clubs, and particularly enjoyed by men. This humidor--designed to preserve expensive Cuban or other imported cigars—has applied “speed line” contours and a tapering front and handle. It resembles components of train engines of the time, whose streamlining increased their speed, but this humidor was all about sitting and enjoying a smoke. Ditto with the collection of modern pipes, with streamlined aluminum bowls for loose tobacco—smoking one would have gotten you compliments, but not anywhere faster. ",
