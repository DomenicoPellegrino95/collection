  "text": "Launching the virtual reality of its day, radio gave listeners real-time experience of national events with broadcasts from NBC and CBS starting in 1926. Music, news, and entertaining radio programs created night-time entertainment for families. Adults held “radio parties” to share in the excitement of popular shows. \r\n \r\nThe Columaire fit in well with the growing radio culture. Advertised as taking up “only one square foot of floor space,” Westinghouse’s vertical design captured the excitement of the new urban skyscrapers while providing superior tonal reception. When flipping on the discreet side controls, listeners were captivated by radio signals traveling through the air as if by magic. ",
