  "text": "Sikora chose this jug because although it is intended to pour out liquids, it has no spout. She especially likes the casual nature of handle as well as the attractive form which pushes the volume off the table. She is particularly interested in kinetic parts of pots: handles and spouts. They also form the active part in her own work. She quickly makes the handles and spouts; often the spouts are folded and then applied.\r\n\n",
