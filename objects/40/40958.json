  "text": "These boxes bring together two stylish entities—the Minneapolis department store of Young-Quinlan, and Armand Albert Rateau, prominent French designer whose historic approach to Art Deco exemplified the more luxurious side of Modern design. \r\n \r\nElizabeth Quinlan, an early champion of modern merchandising, commissioned the Young-Quinlan building in 1926 with amenities like an underground parking garage hidden amongst an elegant European-influenced exterior adorned by bronze plaques by Rateau. Quinlan’s acumen in providing quality ready-to-wear to Twin Cities women brought visiting actresses like Ethel Barrymore to her store. Rateau’s Art Deco logo on this packaging—a stylized Grecian-inspired figure relaxing among a bouquet of flowers—would have signaled shoppers’ good taste as they walked along Nicollet Avenue, Minneapolis’s main shopping street.
