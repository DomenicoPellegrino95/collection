  "text": "Wijdeveld designed this poster in consulation with Frank Lloyd Wright to advertise Wright's one-man exhibition that opened in Amsterdam on May 9, 1931.  The exhibition, which showcased the work of Wright's career through the early 1930s, toured both Europe and the United States.  Today Wijdeveld is recognized for his innovative technique of using printers' brass rules to create the letters and geometric ornaments in his designs.  The combination of the oversized typeface and bold decorative borders Wijdeveld used in this poster became known as the <I>Wendingen Style<I> and was influential in the Netherlands in subsequent decades.",
