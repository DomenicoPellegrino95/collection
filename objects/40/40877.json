  "text": "Top industrial designer Norman Bel Geddes captured the reflections, stepped back elements, and verticality of the city with his \"Manhattan\" cocktail service for Revere. Its tall, fluted shaker, along with rounded tall goblets and stepped tray is composed like buildings on a plaza. The ribbed form of the cocktail shaker \"allows a firm grip and makes pouring easier,\" according to the 1936 Revere product catalogue. It was also affordable for middle-class socialites: in 1937, the 1 1/2 quart shaker was $4.00 ($96.00 in 2015 dollars), and the tray $3.50, with cups at $1.00 each. ",
