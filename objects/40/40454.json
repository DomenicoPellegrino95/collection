  "text": "The \"Hogestoel\" appeared in print for the first time in the Dutch journal, \"de Stijl,\" no. 12, 1920 as part of a decor designed by Theo van Doesburg in 1919.  The same chair was later placed by Rietveld in a clinic at Maarssen (1920), but without the two original side panels.  This particular model was said to have been shown at the seminal Bauhaus exhibitions of 1923, but most scholars today believe that though it had been promised for the show it was never sent.  In any case, there are many analogies which may be drawn between de Stijl philosophies and the basic tenets of the Bauhaus movement.  The chair's form has many affinities with Russian Constructivism also, characterized by planar elements seemingly floating in space.",
