  "text": "Lobed and scalloped lacquer forms that evolved during the Yuan dynasty (1280-1368) remained popular throughout the Ming. In the center of this red lacquer eight-lobed square form dish are three scholars playing a board game. They are surrounded by an eight-lobed reserve carved with sprigs of <i>lingzhi<i> fungus on a star-diaper ground. The cavetto (or inward curve) is carved with sprays of flowering plants against a yellowish-brown plain ground. The exterior is carved with a classic or \"fragrant grass\" scroll in <i> tixi<i> technique.\r\nThe scene suggests a transcendental realm. Although since the centuries before the common era, chess has been seen as a preferred diversion of the immortals, the picture evokes a famous folk story that took place during the Jin dynasty (265-420) on Mount Shishi (or better known as Mount Lanke or Mount of Decomposed Axe-Handle) in Xin’an (in modern Quzhou, Zhejiang province), where the woodcutter Wang Zhi watched immortals playing chess without noticing the passing of great periods of time. From such prototypes a pattern in literature called <i>xianjing guanqi<i> or “watch chess-playing in an immortal realm” developed during the Jin dynasty (265-420), when the Daoist grotto-heaven theory was systemized. Such cultural associations also became profound sources of inspiration for artists, and a great number of works in different mediums were created, particularly in the Ming and Qing dynasties.",
