  "text": "The Hollywood Liquefier, with its dynamic triangular, two-tone base, was the next generation of electric blender. The Waring Mixer Corporation introduced the blender in 1937, and it shortly became a must-have item in American kitchens. It made meal preparation easier and faster by mixing, pureeing, and chopping at the touch of a button. By the 1950s, however, unadulterated function gave into styling and color, both playing a greater role in the modern kitchen. ",
