  "text": "The electric blender was first introduced in 1937 by the Waring Mixer Corporation. Shortly thereafter, the mark of gracious living for many Americans was a blender on the kitchen counter. It made everyday meal preparation far easier-certainly faster-becoming an electrical device for mixing, pureeing, and chopping. By the 1950s, however, unadulterated function gave into styling and color, both playing a greater role in the modern kitchen.  The two-tone Hollywood electric liquefier provided even more panache.",
