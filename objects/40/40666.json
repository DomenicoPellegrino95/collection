  "text": "This four-lobed square box is comprised of four stacking compartments, the lowermost with a flat base set on a raised sloping foot. The deeply carved cover depicts an elderly scholar holding a scepter followed by a young attendant with a <I>ch'in</I> zither under his arm. The two are making their way to a terraced pavilion set amongst rocks and pines. A full moon is ascendant and the whole scene is set against air (sky) and water diaper patterns. The sides of the cover and compartments are each carved with four flowers: chrysanthemum, peony, camellia, and pomegranate. All the floral designs are set against a plain yellow-brown ground. Decorative containers like this could have held any number of small items, but they were not always put to practical use.",
