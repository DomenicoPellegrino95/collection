  "text": "The 1930 Stockholm Exhibition was an important international forum for Modernism, and especially for <I>funkis<I> - the Swedish term for functionalism.  Inadequate housing and a push for social equality following the First World War led to the creation of functional buildings and decorative objects that would be affordable for a wide segment of the population.  Swedish architects and designers used the exhibition as an opportunity to demonstrate their innovations and unique design concepts to the world.  The design of this poster, with its eye-catching colors, circular type, and uncluttered layout, allowed for easy translation into many languages.  This particular poster was used to advertise the exhibition in Spain.",
