  "text": "Esono gwa, the elephant stool, is used exclusively by the Asantehene, king of the Asante.  The elephant is a symbol of the king's power and anyone who sits on it challenges his authority.  The stool is said to contain the Asantehene's sould which symbolizes the collective soul of the kingdom.  Because the well-being of the kingdom depends on the well-being of the king, the stool must be protected at all times.  When not in use the stool is turned on its side so that no adverse force can contaminate the king's soul.",
