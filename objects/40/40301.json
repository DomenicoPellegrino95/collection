  "text": "An air of understatment is evident in most Dreyfuss designs. His goals were less self-promotional than those of his colleagues, Walter Dorwin Teague and Norman Bel Geddes, preferring the word \"cleanlining\" to \"streamlining.\" He distanced himself from what he considered to be the excesses of the '30s restyling movement. This set of pitchers is typical of his approach to industrial design: synthetic materials, clean lines and an absence of personal expression. Yet, not total anonymity. Both pitchers are signed in full on the bottom.",
