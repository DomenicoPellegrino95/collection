  "text": "Among the most active and versatile architect-designers of the modernist period was Gio Ponti. In 1928 he became founder-editor of Domus Magazine which served as a mouthpiece for the Italian Novecento group organized two years earlier. In addition to designing homes he received commissions for a variety of elegant silverware such as this stackable coffee set (distinctive for its Mickey Mouse ear-like handles). Its cylinder form and function anticipates Ponti's famous chromeplated coffee machine for La Pavone in 1949.",
