  "text": "Inspired by the unadorned elegance of contemporary Scandinavian glass, and competing with the fine lead glass being made by Corning's Steuben Glass division, the Libbey Glass Company hired Edwin W. Fuerst to design a line of glassware named \"Modern American.\" Teague collaborated with Fuerst on this \"Embassy\" pattern, a classic Art Deco design with fluted, rectangular stems. \"Embassy\" was chosen by Teague for use in the State Dining Room of the U.S. Government Building at the 1939 New York World's Fair, where it was well exposed.  It was also featured in the 1940 Studio Year Book, an important journal of contemporary decorative arts.",
