  "text": "The \"Big Ben\" is a classic Dreyfuss design, a stylish reworking of an inexpensive alarm clock by creating a smooth rounded shell and tapering base.  Although Dreyfuss began redesigning the clock in the early 1930s, by 1939, when this one was made, the \"Big Ben\" had reached its elegant height.  The strong graphics on the box were also from Dreyfuss's studio, part of the total design and marketing approach; he stated that if the firm was designing a product, \"any detail related to that product in the way of cartons, display, lettering, etc., is part of the job.\"",
