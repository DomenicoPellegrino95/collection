  "text": "Little is know about this children's chair except that it was designed by Piet Zwart for a Montessori school in Wassenaar, Germany.  Zwart was a designer who, like so many of his Dutch De Stijl colleagues, moved comfortably from architecture to furnishings to product and graphic design.  There is, however, an interesting link to another chair design dated 1920 and attributed to Zwart and Vilmos Husz√°r (1884-1960).  Whether it was ever made is unknown, but its blocky components, particular the bottom interlocking rails, are quite similar.",
