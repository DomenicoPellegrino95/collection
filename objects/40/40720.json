  "text": "This stunning, beautifully designed and flawlessly executed bowl belongs to a small group of <I>famille-rose<I> wares that were decorated at a special workshop inside the Forbidden City in Beijing. The imperial kilns at Jingdezhen manufactured very thinly potted, pure white vessels with a specially refined glaze to best display the enamel decorations, which were then painted at the palace by the finest artisans available. At first, these painters used enamels (known as <I>falangcai<I>) that were imported from Europe. Later, the enamels were produced at Jingdezhen from locally available materials.",
