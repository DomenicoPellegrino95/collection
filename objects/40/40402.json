  "text": "Wiwen Nilsson developed a production line including expertly crafted hollow ware, flatware, jewelry, and sculpture after taking over his father's workshop in 1927. Skilled as both a designer and technical expert, Nilsson extended the functionalist impulse in Sweden to abstraction, approaching purely geometric forms throughout the 1930s. This coffee service is a fine example of his tempering of severe angularity and faceting with the addition of reeded molding or a gentle curve in the design.\r\n\r\n",
