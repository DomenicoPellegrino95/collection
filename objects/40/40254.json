  "text": "The strong economy of the 1920s supported a market for luxurious home objects. For French designers like Bouy, who was working in the U.S. by the early 1920s, high-end materials such as maple and bronze and superior craftsmanship expressed a Continental focus on quality furniture. Featuring blue velvet-lined drawers for storing music sheets, spiraling brass hardware, and a sleekly balanced silhouette, this music cabinet is a statement piece. Unlike Franklâ€™s skyscraper furniture that focused on color and overall form, Bouy introduced subtle details and rounded edges into the modernist canon of geometric simplicity.",
