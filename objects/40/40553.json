  "text": "Made by the Japanese potter Hamada Shoji in the early 1950s, these five plates exhibit five different patterns yet unified by similar materials: clay, slips, pigments and oxides. In 1920, Hamada met the English potter Bernard Leach (1887-1979), and together they set up the Leach Pottery in St. Ives, Cornwall, England. While in England Hamada collected English ceramics decorated with slip (or thin clay) trailing, a form of decoration popular from the 16th century to the present . Hamada transformed the traditional English patterns into Japanese expressions.\r\n\n",
