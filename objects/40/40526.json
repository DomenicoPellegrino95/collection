  "text": "A wedding present to Linda Sikora's parents, this pair of salt and paper shakers holds great sentimental value to her. They are also important for the role that they played in her childhood, as Sikora set the table for her parents dinner parties and associates the shakers with formal settings. This has led her to examine the nature of objects, especially ceramics, in their settings and the role they play in special occasions. \r\n\n\r\n\nOn a more formal note, the shakers have also subconsciously influenced Sikora's own work as seen in the pierced decoration on the salt-glazed ewer by her shown nearby.",
