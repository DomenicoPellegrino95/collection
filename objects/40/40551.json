  "text": "Slab built, this covered jar or box is a unique form in the work of the Minnesota artist Tim Crane, as he usually uses spring wire to slice the clay and create patterns. Here he has left the cut surface undecorated except for the slip and the wood ash. Crane experiments with the edges of his pots and the ways that he can join two slabs of clay; here, the edges are not polished, nor pinched. The viewer is aware that the edges have been worked with the hand, and that there are different ones on the top as opposed to the body.\r\n\n",
