  "text": "Wolpert, known as the father of modern Judaica, introduced his Bauhaus-influenced style to a larger audience while teaching at the Bezalel Academy of Art in Jerusalem. In 1956 he moved to the United States to head the Tobe Pascher Workshop at the Jewish Museum in New York, which he continued until his death. This menorah displays Wolpert's characteristic use of Hebrew writing as an integral part of the object's design. It was a present from Wolpert to the current owner.",
