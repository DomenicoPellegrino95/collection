  "text": "The performance given by dancer Loie Fuller (1863-1928), which might have been called mobile illuminative sculpture, fell outside the scope of lighting in the home, but its influence was felt there nevertheless.  This American, with an education background in singing dancing, and acting, became famous for her \"serpentine dance,\" which borrowed its effect from the swirling motion of her fluid garments.  Fuller devoted her life to the perfection of dance as the synthesis of light and Motion.  \r\n\r\nOn November 5, 1892, Fuller made her debut in the Paris Folies Bèrgeres.  Her flowing movements conformed to the curvilinear Art Nouveau style.  She designed a special podium with movable mirrors and rows of colored light bulbs.  This podium was lit, even from below, by means of a sheet of glass.  The impression she made on the audience was overwhelming.  Her dance was a source of inspiration for many artists, one of whom was the French sculptor François-Raoul Larche, who designed several Fuller lamps.\r\n",
