  "text": "This dramatic lacquer box (kesabako) stored a Buddhist monk's robe. The design on its lid represents a fly whisk (hossu) made of animal hair. Such whisks represented the Buddhist reverence for all life because they were used to gently brush away annoying insects without harming them. They also became symbolic of the enlightened mind; portraits of high ranking priests often illustrate the venerable master holding a hossu in the manner of a scepter. \r\n\nIn contrast to the powerful shape of the whisk hairs, depicted in lead inlay, the handle was elaborately rendered in delicate patterns of sprinkled gold powder.",
