  "text": "The Edlund Company is known for its stainless steel equipment designed for \"harsh foodservice environments\" including can crushers, air-powered can openers, mechanical scales and knife sharpeners. This commercial electric knife sharpener features a track guidance system, a stainless steel housing and replaceable grinding wheel assembly. It is all seriousness, a testament to the often observed fact that the postwar \"kitchen of tomorrow\" appeared more like a chem lab or factory.",
