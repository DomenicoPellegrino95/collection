  "text": "Shaped and decorated to resemble a drum, this large circular box and cover were created with the <I>tian-ch'i</I> or \"filled-in\" technique. It has contrasting color fields of red, green, black, and reddish-brown lacquer. After the surface was polished, the outlines and details were engraved and gilded. The fine gold powder in the grooves was held in place with a clear lacquer adhesive. \r\n<P>On the cover is a gold five-clawed dragon shown full face amongst clouds above rocks and waves with a flaming pearl in the center. These imperial emblems exist against a muted brown swastika diaper ground. The sides of both box and cover are painted with roundels imitating the studs of a stretched leather drum head. The sides are decorated below and above with engraved and gilded continuous lotus scrolls. The <I>tian-ch'i</I> technique was popular during Ming and early Ch'ing for the decoration of fine lacquer furniture.",
