  "text": "Made while Mark Pharis was teaching at the Anderson Ranch Art Center outside Aspen, Colorado, in 1988, this teapot illustrates Pharis's experimentation and investigation of the formal nature of pots. Pharis continues to explore the inherently symmetrical nature of ceramics and attempts to create asymmetries. Viewers and users tend look at pots, especially those used to pour liquids, from one angle. Pharis tries to create different facades, yet ones that create unity within the pot. The two \"sides\" of this teapot, although very similar show different facades. When the object is seen from above, however, Pharis has created a symmetrical ovoid. Pharis has also exaggerated the form of the teapot, especially in the elongated spout and handle, yet the inherent function of the object remains recognizable. The teapot is functional but Pharis did not necessarily intend for it to be used.",
