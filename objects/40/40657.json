  "text": "Suitable for a scholar's brush tray, this exquisitely crafted object has been inlaid with minute pieces of shell using the mother-of-pearl technique called <I>lo-tien<I> by the Chinese. The interior of the tray is inset with engraved pieces of mollusk shell to depict a waterside scene with groups of people standing in terraced buildings, a small procession crossing a footbridge, and a boatman poling his small craft. The sides are decorated with scrolling flowerheads in shaped reserves surrounded by a hexagonal diaper pattern with still smaller flowers. Popular since the T'ang dynasty (618-906), the mother-of-pearl technique was expanded during the Yuan (1280-1368) dynasty to include complex pictorial representation. Landscapes, birds, and flower subject matter remained popular well into the seventeenth century.",
