This pair is decorated with two dragons in iron-red, one descending from the closed top, the other rising below it, and with the five bats <I>wufu</I>, all in iron-red with the eyes picked out in black, flying among dense underglaze-blue clouds. This shows the luxurious uses to which porcelain was applied for Imperial use.",
