  "text": "Lalique is one of the most recognized names in glass production today and the firm's reputation originated with its popular Art Deco designs of the 1920s.  A familiar motif to the Art Deco style was the floral bouquet, and Lalique used a stylized version of it in this lighting device, or luminaire.  Intended to create ambience in a dark setting, the luminaire produced a soft, warm glow lit through bulbs placed in the metal base.\r\n",
