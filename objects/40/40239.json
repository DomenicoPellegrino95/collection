  "text": "From an unlikely beginning as an ironworks, Orrefors went on to become one of the foremost glassmaking firms in Sweden, a position assured with such gifted talents as Simon Gate and Edward Hald, who collaborated on unique showpieces that brought the company international fame. Initially a portrait landscape painter, Gate joined Orrefors in 1916 and, along with Hald, became a leader of modernism in Swedish glass design. \r\n\r\nThis bowl and underplate were exhibited in the Swedish pavilion at the famous 1925 Exposition des arts DÃ©coratifs et Industriels Moderne in Paris where Gate received a Grand Prix for his collective work. The classical theme of dancing nudes amidst scrolling foliage is intricately engraved and visually captivating, a clear example of why his elegant and expensive glassworks among the most popular features at the Exposition.\r\n\r\n",
