  "text": "For Johnston, this unglazed Korean covered bowl on stand is exciting to look at because it breaks so many rules of ceramics and design, including proportions and surface: the unglazed clay is over-fired and the surface is blistered; the lid does not fit either because the lids and bottoms were made separately by the hundreds and then paired up or this is a replacement lid. Warren MacKenzie gave this pot to Randy Johnston and his wife Jan as a wedding present.",
