  "text": "This 17-piece cubic storage set was a breakthrough, fusing function and aesthetics in a unified design concept. Intended for maximum efficiency and made of heat-resistant glass (a new material), the set could be used in the pantry or refrigerator, as individual pieces, or as a set. The seven containers and three lid types were made in different assembly lines, making it impossible to achieve perfect similarity in color within any set. Later versions of the containers were produced by other glass factories.",
