  "text": "Warren MacKenzie selected this African water carrier or gorf, not only for the strong form but for the interaction of different materials, including wood, raffia, leather and pitch employed by the craftsman to create a vessel capable of holding water. A log was hollowed out and patched with leather while the bottom and the rim were made more water proof by sewing or weaving raffia onto the log. Women of Borana or Gabra carry these water carriers woven baskets on their backs.",
