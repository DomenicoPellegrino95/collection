  "text": "This print is from a series that depicts six of the most famous courtesans from the Yoshiwara, Edo's licensed pleasure quarter. It shows the courtesan Hinazuru looking over her shoulder, as if someone has just called her name. In front of her is a green bookstand casually covered by a red cloth. More books litter the floor, suggesting that we are peeking into her private room. She sits upon a carpet woven with an exotic arabesques pattern indicating that it was probably imported. All these details, as well as her splendid dress, imply a high level of sophistication and luxury. Such images held a strong allure for men, who dreamed of visiting such women. Their wives, too, took an interest in such prints, studying them for information about the latest fashions and interior décor. ",
