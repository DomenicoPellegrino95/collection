  "text": "Depicting actors with beautiful women may have been an attempt by print publishers to capitalize on the commercial popularity of these two artistic genres.  Torii Kiyonaga (1752-1815) was the first artist to depict actors and women together, and Katsukawa Shunch√∏ later followed this lead. In this print, the actor in the center can be identified as Ichikawa Monnosuke II (1743-94) based on the family crest on his shoulder and sleeve. The actor Onoe Matsusuke (1744-1815) is shown seated on the bench with his crest displayed on his nearby jacket. The two men chat with a waitress, suggesting that the scene is taking place at a teahouse. This kind of prints must have catered to the popular interest of Kabuki fans in their favorite stars' private lives.\r\n\r\n",
