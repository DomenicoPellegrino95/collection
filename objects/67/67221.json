Fox masks are used exclusively for the play \"Tsurigitsune,\" in which a wily old fox transforms himself into a priest to convince a hunter to give up meat, and thus follow the Buddha's teachings. The ruse nearly works until the fox, distracted by the smell of the hunters roasted rat bait, begins to revert to his true form. ",
