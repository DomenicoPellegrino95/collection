  "text": "To many, the Atomic Age conveys rather sinister implications.  Yet, resourceful artists and designers have incorporated its familiar elements - particularly rods and spheres - into witty references to atomic particles.  Particularly noteworthy is this  Atomic wall clock, one of a series of electric wall and table clocks George Nelson designed for the Howard Miller Clock Company beginning in 1949.  His many clock designs were produced in variety of colors and materials.  Today, several (including this period piece) have been reissued with slight modifications.  This coral-colored model is rather rare, being among the first produced by the company.  As a prolific writer, critic, and designer, Nelson's ideas were extremely influential and forward-looking.",
