  "text": "Peppered with bizarre and medieval-looking creatures, Funeral March for the Minimal Man is part of a long art-historical tradition of the grotesque, as found in the drawings of Leonardo Da Vinci and paintings of Hieronymous Bosch. The artist, who is self-taught and based in Minneapolis, makes use of fantastical imagery in his work in order to comment directly on the mental health profession. ",
