  "text": "Abstract expressionist painter and printmaker Robert Motherwell is internationally recognized for his important contributions to avant-garde art and thought. His numerous essays on the abstract expressionists are considered central to understanding the conceptual framework of this art movement. Motherwell saw elimination of the inessential as a way to reveal what he saw as the necessary. His work possesses both compelling visual elegance and personally expressive emotional depth, characteristics apparent in this suite of screenprints. ",
