  "text": "Based on the principle that human perception of color is a relative concept, Josef Alber's \"Interaction of Color\" has become a standard text for many art and design schools. Featuring Alber's theoretical writings on color, this rare first edition of the publication features 150 color screenprints that demonstrate such principles as color relativity, intensity, and temperature; vibrating and vanishing boundaries; and the illusions of transparency and reversed grounds. The color plates were printed at the firm of Ives-Sillman in New Haven, Conn., who were frequent collaborators on Albers's various print publications.\r\n",
