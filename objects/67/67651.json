As a commemoration of this historic event, he produced a series of 33 prints he called the Stoned Moon series. In addition to using his own images, Rauschenberg worked with photographs and other material supplied by NASA. The project, which was took nearly a year to complete, was completed at Gemini G.E.L. in Los Angeles.",
