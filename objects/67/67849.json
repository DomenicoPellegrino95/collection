  "text": "Richard Tuttle produces works of art that often defy easy categorization. Working in a diverse array of art forms-from sculpture and installations to drawing and printmaking-Tuttle radically confronts and overturns artistic conventions. His work may at first appear visually simple or ephemeral, but with thoughtful attention it grows more complex and nuanced. Indeed, Tuttle typically manipulates the space in which his objects exist, emphasizing both the scale of his objects (forms) and the conceptual structure of his work, here expressed as the \"empty\" surface of the paper punctuated with a single rectangle.
