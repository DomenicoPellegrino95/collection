  "description": "Two women with an umbrella cross a bridge over the river, Sumidagawa, in the heavy snowfall. This print illustrates Yanagibashi ('the Willow bridge') over the river Kanda near its convergence with the Sumida. Independent landscape scenes are only a small group in Koson's work. This image, in its great simplicity and effective use of only a few colours, is one of his most beautiful designs. (Newland 2010)",
