  "text": "Clement Haupers was a student of realism, a tradition that extended to his weighty figures and regional landscapes. In the late 1920s he and companion Clara Mairs (1878-1963) found inspiration for their printmaking during a summer trip to southern France. Starting in 1935, Haupers directed the regional activities of the Works Progress Administration's Federal Art Project. Much of the Depression-era art in Minnesota's public buildings was commissioned during his watch.",
