  "description": "Bed drapery of white hand made linen, embroidered with red silk. The drapery consists of four side curtains, and two for foot and one for head; a coverlet and three valences for tester. The swastika vase and other ornati forms lines and borders of curtains; these are double-faced embroidery, alike on both sides. Coverlet and valances are single-faced embroidery. Transversal lines of a similar design separate large squares of ornati in coverlet. This work in good preservation except for a few repairs in linen, stains and one side-valence has a piece of its length torn off. Part of a group including objects 389-392.",
