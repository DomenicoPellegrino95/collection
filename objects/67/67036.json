  "text": "St. Paul the Hermit spent more than 60 years living a contemplative, reclusive life, using the leaves of a palm tree to weave his cloak and subsisting only on a half loaf of bread brought to him daily by a raven. While St. Anthony only visited the hermit once at the end of St. Paul’s life, Dürer depicts the two hermits meeting as old friends, enjoying a makeshift picnic, the raven providing food like a divine waiter.
