  "text": "Clubs were the favorite weapon of Tongan warriors, and the higher the rank, the better the quality.  The fineness and unusual depth of the carving, expertly sculpted from hard wood, plus the inclusion of incised human figures and animals, make this one the property of a chief.  There are many layers of symbolism in the weapon's design.  Its rounded head references a crocodile, an animal respected for its power and ferocity. The repeated iclusion of shark and turtle motifs underscores the associations to regal and divine authority. Connections to powerful beings are also indicated through the carved human figures, who represent the ruler's notable ancestors.",
