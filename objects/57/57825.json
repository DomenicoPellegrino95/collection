Today, only two designs are known, suggesting that he abandoned the idea shortly after beginning. For this image, Hiroshige was inspired by a poem originally published in the <I>Wakan Ro_eishu_<I> (Anthology of Chinese and Japanese Poems for Recitation), compiled in the 11th century by the courtier Fujiwara Kinto_:\r\n\r\n\t\t<P><I>It is not unbearable to see maple leaves fall,<I>\r\n\t\t<P><I>Scattering on the mass-covered ground.<I>\r\n\t\t<P><I>It is unbearable to feel the wind grow chilly<I>\r\n\t\t<P><I>And see the whole sky darkening.<I>\r\n\t\t\t\t<P><I>(trans. by Yoko Woodson)<I>\r\n",
