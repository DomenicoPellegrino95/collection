  "text": "When Hendrick Goltzius wanted to honor friend Dirck de Vries with a portrait of his son Frederik, he cast the boy as a falconer, his bird a dove. Falconry began in Asia around 700 b.c.e., when raptors were trained to hunt and bring back meat. European rulers turned falconry into a courtly obsession, as seen in the museumâ€™s magnificent Falconers tapestry in Gallery 340. Present-day enthusiasts are good and bad for raptors, some protecting them with captive breeding and others heartlessly robbing their nests.",
