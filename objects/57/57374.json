  "text": "While his fellow printmakers were depicting the American scene, Benjamin Miller was pursuing agonizingly expressive subjects from the Bible. This Judith gives us a frank acknowledgement of her sexual power, but also hints at the psychological cost of her deed. The print's raw emotionalism is enhanced by the actual wood grain incorporated into the background design. ",
