  "text": "Considered one of the milestones of early modernism, this collaborative artist’s book features a prose-poem by Blaise Cendrars recalling a journey he made as a boy on the Trans-Siberian Express, which runs from St. Petersburg, Russia, to the Sea of Japan. His companion on the trip is Jeanne, a French prostitute, and as the barren landscape rushes by him on the train, he recounts his childhood in Paris and imagines traveling to tropical paradises. Abstract designs in watercolor pochoir (stenciling) by Sonia Delaunay-Terk guide the reader though the text, the colors reflecting the mood and content of the poem. Together, the images and text achieve simultaneisme, or a “simultaneous book.”\r\n \r\nIntended as an edition of 150, fewer were printed and only about 30 copies are thought to have survived. Made from four sheets of folded paper and bound accordion-style, the book measures 6 feet, 6-1/2 inches when extended. Placed end to end, the edition was designed to equal the height of the Eiffel Tower, Paris’s commanding symbol of modernity.  \r\n ",
