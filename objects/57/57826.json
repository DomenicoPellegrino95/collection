  "text": "Kakinomoto Hitomaro was a great poet and, after his death around 739, he was deified as a Shinto god. In his poem, written here in the upper portion of the print, he emphasizes the loneliness of autumn: \r\n\r\n   <I><P>Ah, the foot-drawn trail\r\n    <Pp>of the mountain-pheasant's tail\r\n   <P>dropped like a down-curved branch\r\n    <P>Through this long, long-dragging night\r\n    <P>must I keep my cushion alone'<I> \r\n\r\n<p>Kuniyoshi strengthened the autumnal association within his composition by picturing autumn grasses, the full moon, and maple leaves as decoration on the small folding screen near Hitomaro.
