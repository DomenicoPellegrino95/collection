  "text": "\r\nKakinomoto Hitomaro was a great poet and, after his death around 739, he was deified as a Shinto god. In his poem, written here in the upper portion of the print, he emphasizes the loneliness of autumn: \r\n\r\n\t\t\t<I><P>Ah, the foot-drawn trail\r\n\t\t\t\t<Pp>of the mountain-pheasant's tail\r\n\t\t\t<P>dropped like a down-curved branch\r\n\t\t\t\t<P>Through this long, long-dragging night\r\n\t\t\t\t<P>must I keep my cushion alone'<I> \r\n\r\n<p>Kuniyoshi strengthened the autumnal association within his composition by picturing autumn grasses, the full moon, and maple leaves as decoration on the small folding screen near Hitomaro.  \r\n",
