  "text": "The fallen hero at right in Kehinde Wiley's painting bears a striking resemblance to the mutilated, prostrate victim in Goya's <I>Disasters of War</I> print. Among the artistic devices Wiley borrows from the old masters is the figure in extreme foreshortening, a pose traditionally used to signify death. \r\n\r\nArtists have employed this forceful, concise convention since the Renaissance, often as a test of their virtuosity. We implicitly understand its meaning-a body represented this way would not be mistaken as asleep. One winces to imagine lying on the ground and being seen from this angle, which implies a total lack of bodily control and power. \r\n\r\nOften the pose is shown in connection with another visual signifier: the palms of the hands shown open and displayed. This is the case with Wiley's two fallen men, and also can be seen in Alessandro Turchi's dead Christ. As Hans Baldung's woodcut shows, the prominent attention to the bottoms of the feet can also effectively mark the body as a corpse or, at best, someone knocked unconscious by a horse's hoof.",
