  "text": "Popularly (but perhaps improperly) known as the \"Lego\" phone, this playful design was aimed at young and old.  Produced in a Lego-like casing, it featured a side drawer to accommodate loose Legos to toy with while chatting on the phone.  Did you know that two bricks with eight studs can be combined in 24 different ways; four bricks yield 1,060 combinations; and six bricks more than 100 million'  From the '60s through '80s, the emphasis in telephone design dramatically shifted from instruments of necessity to entertainment devices.",
