  "text": "Only commercially available since the late 19th century, aluminum played a huge role in the modern era—its lightweight properties made it suitable for everything from airships to cookware. Otto Wagner, one of the first modernist architects working in Vienna, pioneered the use of this new material in architecture and furniture. Aluminum is only one modern component of the chair, though. Its top rail, arms, and front legs are a continuous curve of beechwood painted black for a dramatic, graphic look, with aluminum punctuation at the feet. \r\n\r\n \r\n ",
