  "text": "Tea masters use small scoops, known as <I>chashaku<I>, to measure and draw powdered tea from delicate tea containers. Tea enthusiasts prize these humble objects because they are often fashioned by tea masters themselves, rather than by professional artisans. While scoops of precious metals, iron, and ivory are known, bamboo is preferred because of the natural beauty of its surface variations, and because there is little chance that a bamboo scoop will damage the delicate mouths of ceramic and lacquer tea caddies. \r\n",
