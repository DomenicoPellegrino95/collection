  "text": "Here, Hiroshige depicted a street scene in Suruga-ch√∏, near Nihonbashi. The building at the corner, as identified on the indigo shop curtains and the wooden board, is the famous Echigoya textile shop. A straw rope (shimenawa) festooned with fern fronds hangs from the building's joist-a traditional New Year's decoration. Two men in green robes are manzai dancers who perform a comical dance-and-song routine. Two women holding guitar-like instruments are torioi singers. Entering from the right is a daikagura troupe whose members perform the auspicious \"lion dance\" and a variety of acrobatic feats. With all these street performers strolling around, the streets in Edo on New Year's Day were undoubtedly very lively.   ",
