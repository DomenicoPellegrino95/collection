  "text": "The Virgin Mary holds the newborn Jesus as the three kings, or wise men, present gifts of gold as well as aromatic frankincense and myrrh. Traces of bold color reveal how the artist painted directly on smooth alabaster, an easily carved, creamy stone that looks different than marble. The decorative green ground and golden star-speckled sky hint at what it might have looked like fully colored. This was once combined with other panels as part of a larger altarpiece illustrating the life of Jesus.",
