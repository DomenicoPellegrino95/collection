  "text": "This painting depicts the Buddhist monk, Xianzi, who retreated into the wilderness to attain enlightenment. Having no affiliation with any monastery, Xianzi adopted a nomadic lifestyle and foraged for food.  Because he was unaffiliated with a monastery, he did not adhere to the strict code of vegetarianism for Buddhist monks. Here, he holds a large shrimp, for which he became legendary for collecting from lakes and rivers. The quick broad brushstrokes defining his figure and the freely painted calligraphy also characterize Zen paintings from Japan.",
