  "text": "These vases are notable for the quality of their neoclassical decoration, including engraved garlands of flowers, kissing doves, and vessels crowned with leaves of celery stalks.  The latter embellishment is self-referential, as the vase was intended to display celery.  Based on its shape and skillfully executed decoration, it was probably made by Bakewell, Page and Bakewell, the first firm in America to excel in the production of cut and engraved glass.  The firm came to prominence through furnishing the White House with glass during the Madison, Monroe, and Jackson administrations.\r\n<P>The monogram “WMW” represents the vase’s first owners, William and Mathilda Dallas Wilkins.  In 1839 the Wilkins bought a grand country estate near Pittsburgh called Homewood.  There the vase remained and subsequently passed down through the family before acquired by the museum.",
