  "text": "This celery vase is one of a pair noted for the quality of neoclassical decoration, including engraved garlands of flowers, kissing doves, and vessels crowned with the leaves of celery stalks.  The last embellishment is self-referential, as this vase was used for displaying celery.  based on its shape and skillfully executed decoration, it was probably made by Bakewell, Page and Bakewell, the first firm in America to excel in the production of cut and engraved glass.  Bakewell employed the most successful English and Continental European glass engravers who had recently immigrated to America.  The firm came to prominenence through furnishing the White House with glass during the Madison, Monroe, and Jackson administrations.\r\n\r\nThe engraved monogram on the vases, \"WmW\"",
