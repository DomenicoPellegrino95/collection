  "text": "Commonly called the \"oil can\" phone due to its suggestive profile, this \"classic candlestick\" form derives from the practical necessity of keeping the transmitter upright.  However, the apparent simplicity of the design is misleading, for the telephone requires a separate bell set (containing induction coil, capacitor and ringer) in order to operate.  The nickname \"candlestick\" is a modern term; at the time these phones were manufactured they were called \"desk stands.\"",
