  "text": "This break-through model ended the reign of the \"candlestick\" or \"desk stand\" telephone.  All components are packaged in one sleek, sturdy body with the speaker and the microphone mounted in the shapely handset.  The bell is hidden in the base eliminating the need for a separate ringer box.  Initially called a \"desk set\" model, it became a staple in the home as well.",
