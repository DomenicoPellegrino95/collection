  "text": "The \"Shakespeare\" tile series was the largest and one of the most popular designed by Moyr Smith, with twenty-four different scenes from the Bard's works. As in the \"Anacreon\" plates featured here, he applied historically accurate dress for his scenes. Moyr Smith was responsible for approximately twenty different tile series for Mintons in the 1870s and 1880s, featuring literature and other subjects; his appealing tiles added an artistic touch to middle-class English and American interiors for relatively little cost.",
