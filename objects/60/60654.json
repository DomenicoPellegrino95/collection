  "text": "Commemorating Ericsson's centenary anniversary, an adaptation of the earlier \"Ericofon\" was introduced in 1976, produced in push-button only and given a more sharply defined silhouette.  The colors were likewise intensified reflecting the times.  The model 700 never captured the public's favor enjoyed by the earlier curvaceous model.  Only 30,000 models were manufactured through 1984.",
