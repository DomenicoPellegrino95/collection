  "text": "Marguerite Wildenhain trained in ceramics at the Bauhaus in Weimar, a center for modernist design education begun by Walter Gropius. Apprenticing there from 1919-25, she learned technical proficiency through repetition, and later taught ceramics at the School of Fine and Applied Arts in Halle-Salle, Germany. She realized the value of good design for industry, one of the leading tenets of the Bauhaus, and produced tableware designs for Royal Berlin Porcelain works.  \r\n\r\nAs a Jew feeling increased pressure from the Nazis, she fled first to the Netherlands and then in 1940 to the United States, where in 1942 she set up a pottery at the communal Pond Farm retreat near Guerneville, California. She taught there until 1980, while also traveling and conducting workshops in the United States and across the globe. These Wildenhain pieces produced at Pond Farm employ the same forms she perfected while in Europe, adorned with very simple earthen glazes and incised decoration. Her works were sold in department stores such as Gump's in San Francisco.\r\n",
