  "text": "In the '70s and '80s, novelty telephones became the craze.  Catering to a younger generation becoming increasingly hooked on telephones, manufacturers added frivolity and personality to the necessity of the telephone.  Many models were produced in the form of cartoon characters.  This phone, named after Alexander Graham Bell who invented the telephone in 1876, was cleverly modeled into an airplane - a telephone flight of fancy.",
