  "text": "Variously described as the \"Grillo\" or \"Cricket\" phone, its compact form suggests the carapace of an insect or clamshell while giving no indication of its function.  It was just this kind of playfulness that was characteristic of post-war Italian design and further encouraged the fun-phone rage.  Produced in both rotary-style and push-button in several colors, the mouthpiece and main body are hinged so the unit may be folded away when not in use.  The ringer is located in the plug.  This design was awarded the coveted Italian Compasso d'Oro prize for design.",
