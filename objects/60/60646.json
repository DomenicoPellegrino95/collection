  "text": "Taking advantage of new, lighter materials and of miniaturized technology, Ericsson developed a compact plastic phone that included user-friendly components (earpiece, mouthpiece, dial and switch) in one unit, the first single-element (one-piece) telephone.  The design of the model combines a sensuality of form with advanced technology.  The earpiece and transmitter are contained in a unified plastic body, and the dial is installed in the base.  Described as \"a technical sculpture,\" the phone was initially offered in 18 colors; the selection was later reduced to the eight examples on view in this installation.",
