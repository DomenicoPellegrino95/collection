  "text": "Huet helped revolutionize landscape painting in the 1820s by bridging the French and British traditions. In fact, he was sharing a Paris studio with the French master Eug√®ne Delacroix and the influential English artist Richard Parkes Bonington when he painted this early gem.\r\nThe painting combines the delicate naturalism of English landscapes by Bonington and John Constable with the exquisite drama of Rubens, Rembrandt, and other Old Masters. Huet's work is linked to a specific landscape, a former royal hunting preserve northeast of Paris, where the caretaker's cottage was once the gamekeeper's home.",
