  "text": "Zen masters have long drawn circles (<I>enso_<I>) in the air, scratched them in the sand, and painted them on silk and paper as symbols of perfection and the enlightened mind. Taido_ was a Rinzai Zen priest and abbot of Daitokuji, an important monastery located in Kyoto. Here, he brushed a perfectly round enso_ with the following couplet: \r\n\r\n<P><I>With a heart permeated with innocence<I>\r\n<P><I>The virtuous dragon walks alone.<I>\r\n\r\n<P>According to Sen Rikyu_ (1522-91), Japan's most famous tea master, calligraphy by Zen priests is the most appropriate decoration for the tea ceremony. \r\n",
