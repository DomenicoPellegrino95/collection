  "text": "By the sixteenth century, Japanese painters had become adept at producing meditative landscapes based on the imagined mountains and rivers of China. They based their works on Chinese Southern Song prototypes by Ma Yuan and Hsia Kuei. Stylistically, however, the Japanese approach--particularly those artists associated with the Kano school, was more decorative, especially when applied to the large format of folding screens. Painters sharply outlined their trees and rocks and textured them with rhythmic patterns of dots and dashes. They also applied washes of gold for dramatic effect. This pair of screens also displays a compositional mode frequently used by Kano painters of framing a misty waterway with mountains. By varying seasonal motifs from right to left, they also suggest the passage of the seasons from summer to autumn.",
