  "text": "While Henry Dreyfuss is credited with the design of the \"trimline,\" Donald Genaro, who joined Dreyfuss Associates shortly after Henry Dreyfuss introduced the model 500 rotary-dial model, may well have been its principal author.  On earlier models, dialing numbers were written on the inside of the finger holes of an opaque wheel.  Users had to wait until the wheel returned to its starting point before they could aim at the next number.  Dreyfuss simply moved the numbers and letters outside the wheel, now made of clear Lucite, and replaced them with tiny dots.",
