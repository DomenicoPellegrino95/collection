  "text": "Paul Soldner was Peter Voulkos's first and only ceramics student for his first quarter teaching at the Los Angeles County Art Institute (now the Otis College of Art and Design). Faced with a basically empty room for the new program, Voulkos and Soldner built the studio by hand, including pottery wheels, kilns, tables, and shelves. Soon Soldner was joined by other students, including John Mason and Ken Price, in the studio. Soldner describes the loose, non-academic atmosphere: \"People began dropping in. They did not enroll. They just worked. It was dynamic....We all realized there was something very exciting happening.\"\r\n\r\nSoldner is one of the leading American exponents of raku, a technique he used on this piece. In raku, a pot with low-fire glazes is introduced into the kiln after the temperature has exceeded 750 degrees. When the glaze has melted, the pot is removed. Soldner describes raku as \"serendipity,\" approached with an openness to chance that is linked back to the Zen Buddist roots of the Japanese technique.",
