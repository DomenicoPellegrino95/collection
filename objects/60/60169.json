  "text": "Ingrain carpet is an American term for a flat, double-weave wool carpet in which the colors of the design on one side are reversed on the other.  It is called \"ingrain\" because the yarn or fiber is dyed before weaving.  These inexpensive yet durable carpets became popular in mid-nineteenth century America for use in hallways, stairs and large rooms.  Responding to this new market, several American textile mills invested in steam-powered looms capable of efficiently producing ingrain carpets in variations of repeat designs.  In this example, the floral design is softened by the gradual mutation of the colors and the contrasting vertical borders.",
