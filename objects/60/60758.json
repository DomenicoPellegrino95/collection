Carved by men, they were used primarily for utilitarian and ceremonial purposes; decorated examples were highly regarded.  The head on this bowl probably represents Eyah, the spirit of \"eating heartily.\"  Carving an image of Eyah on a bowl reinforced the custom of consuming large amounts of offered food.",
