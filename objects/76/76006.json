  "text": "While men's fashion favored wigs into the early nineteenth century, women wore their natural hair but styled it to extraordinary heights. This trend, combined with the fad for tall hats-elaborately appointed with feathers, ribbons, and flowers-is shown presenting challenges at the theater. As the inscription on the print observes, \" This is all very well for the folks in the front seats.\" It was joked that women wearing such foolish hairstyles and hats were unable to fit into their coaches and were consigned, to their great humiliation, to ride on the floor.",
