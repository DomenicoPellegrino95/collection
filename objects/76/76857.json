  "text": "The artist Chang Yin was from Tan-tu in Kiangsu province. His father, Chang Ch'i-kun, was a well-known collector and painter of birds and flowers. Although Chang passed his first level exam, he never held office. He was a precocious artist, especially drawn to landscape painting. Chang modeled himself after Shen Chou (1427-1509), the founder of the Wu School, and he eventually studied the Sung and Yuan masters (10th-14th century) who had inspired Shen Chou.\r\n<P>Chang Yin was unwilling to follow the Ch'ing orthodox literati style perpetuated by the Four Wangs. Chang created his own pictorial style: heavy, dense, and substantial brushwork with themes and motifs derived from the great Sung masters. This is particularly fine painting by Chang, the scholars enjoying the surrounding landscape from a rustic pavilion carries strong Sung overtones in both composition and brushwork.",
