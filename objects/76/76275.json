  "text": "Strapwork was a hallmark of ornament design in Germany and the Low Countries. The motif probably grew from the decorative metalwork nailed to chests and other furniture, as well as the rolled edges of cut leather. Countless variations of strapwork found their way into 16th-century prints and book illustrations. This thick, high-relief style had become outdated by 1590, when tastes turned to the flat strapwork seen on Paul Flindt's tankard design in this exhibition.",
