  "text": "Tired of life on his Northumberland estate, Prideaux John Selby set out to record every known species of bird in Britain. The telltale tufts on this great horned owl are not ears but rather feathers—adaptations to help it stay concealed. (This owl’s actual ears are so sensitive, it can detect a mouse under snow from high in a tree.) Selby drew his illustrations from skinned birds, unlike John James Audubon, who relied mostly on fresh specimens.",
