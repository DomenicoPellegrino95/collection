  "text": "Compared to the map by Abraham Ortelius (above), this map by Hendrik Hondius shows considerable refinement of the American continents. Ricci had incorporated the more accurate outline of South America seen here, but his map preceded the information pouring forth from the explorations of North America that was available to Hondius. Hondius delineated Canada's northeast coast with new exactness, including recently charted territories like Baffin Island (Queen Anne Forland) and Hudson Bay (Buttons Bay). However, his map regressed in showing California and the Baja peninsula as an island.",
