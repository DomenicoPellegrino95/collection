  "text": "Viscount Linley, nephew of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, has achieved an international reputation as a designer and craftsman of fine furniture.  This desk was inspired by decorative elements from the Triumphal Arch of Septimius Serverus in Rome.  A hinged compartment in the architectural gallery on the top bears a Latin inscription in marquetry stating the virtues of Septimus Serverus and his son.  The ebony bas-relief frieze below the top depicts carved scenes of architecture, horses and people that are reproduced from the original Arch.  Seven Roman coins from the reign of Septimius Serverus have been incorporated into the object.",
