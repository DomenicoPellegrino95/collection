  "text": "This small album contains twelve miniature landscapes done in various styles of inky brushplay. The artist displays excellent control of brush and ink, instilling atmosphere and unique character into each composition. The last leaf is dated 1742 and signed Chou Li. Chou Li's art name was Mu shan and he was the son of Chou Hao. Both men were noted bamboo carvers as well as painters and came from the famous bamboo carving center of Chia-ting in Kiangsu province. The literati were often well-rounded artists proficient in more than one medium. The technical precision displayed in these small pictorial formats likely grew out of discipline required to carve small bamboo objects.",
