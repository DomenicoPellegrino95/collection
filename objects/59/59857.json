  "text": "Robert Arneson's portrait busts, though a referencing a longstanding artistic tradition, embodied his identification with the California \"Funk\" movement--less a style than an attitude. He employed vivid glazes and facial expressions that recalled both pop culture and Pop Art. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, Arneson's work rises above material and process, which he himself considered irrelevant to the final product.  He made personal statements by depicting himself, and also celebrated through portraiture the work of other artists he admired, including Van Gogh, Picasso and Jackson Pollock. <I>Viola with Gold</I> is a powerful and passionate portrayal of his friend, the influential ceramic artist Viola Frey, who helped define 20th century ceramic sculpture along with Arneson and Peter Voulkos (whose sculpture <I>Sevillanas</I> is on view in Gallery 376).  \r\n",
