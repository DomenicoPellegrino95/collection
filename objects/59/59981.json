  "text": "This Confucian poem is written in seal script (<I>chuan-shu<I>) by the innovative calligrapher and critic, Wang Shu. During the Yung-cheng era (1723-35), as a result of the revived interest in archaeological and philological studies (<I>Han-hsueh<I>) which sought authentic sources for ancient texts, Ch'ing scholars began to seriously study the inscriptions on bronze and stone monuments. These ancient inscriptions served as sources for epigraphical studies and expressive calligraphy. Wang Shu turned directly to rubbings of Eastern Chou (770-256 B.C.) and T'ang (618-906) masters to develop a style based on the thin, wiry, perfection of ancient seal script. His thin, strong, perfectly even strokes called \"iron wire\" seal script (<I>t'ieh hsien-chuan<I>) became a typical product of his generation. The characters in this scroll display a subtle \"modulation\" of ink tone, a rare variant of his classic unmodulated \"iron wire\" stroke.",
