  "text": "This twelve leaf album consists of six landscape paintings with facing pages of poetic calligraphy. Both paintings and calligraphy are by Chang Yin, the innovative founder of the Chen-chiang school. Chen-chiang is a small city located between Suchou and Nanking on the south bank of the Yangtze river in Kiangsu province. Although a relatively small city, Chen-chiang produced several respected painters during the eighteenth century including Ts'ai Chia, Chang-yin, Chang Ch'i, and Chiang Chang. These paintings by Chang Yin have a luminous lyrical quality to them. The compositions are kept clear and simple while the calligraphy is appropriately elegant.",
