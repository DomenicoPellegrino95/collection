  "text": "In 1930, Lurelle Guild left a career as an illustrator to pursue industrial design. Soon his clients included such elite companies as General Electric, New Haven Railroad, Chase Brass & Copper Company, International Silver and The Aluminum Company of America for whom this coffee maker was designed. Guild's work is well represented in the Institute's collection, this piece being the latest addition. The inexpensive coffee maker appealed to those looking for a softer touch to hard-edge geometry.",
