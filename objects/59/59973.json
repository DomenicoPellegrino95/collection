  "text": "Although mounted as hanging scrolls, these four album leaves and their accompanying calligraphy sheets were originally mounted together in an album along with four other leaves each illustrating one of the \"Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup.\" An appropriate stanza is inscribed alongside each nobly drunken subject. Those illustrated here include Prince Ju-yang, the devout Buddhist Su Chin, the great T'ang poet Li Po, and finally, Chiao Sui. There are several further calligraphic inscriptions. These descriptive and appreciative colophons were presumably contributed during the course of an extensive wine-drinking party. The artist, Chang Heng, was a figure painter from Suchou active during the early to mid part of the nineteenth century.",
