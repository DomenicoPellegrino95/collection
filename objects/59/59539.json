  "text": "One of Farny's most widely known paintings, The Song of the Talking Wire is typical of the Native American motifs the artist favored. Confronted with the novel paraphernalia of progress, the Sioux presses his ear against the telegraph pole out of curiosity and bewilderment. Here, the artist utilizes subdued coloring, a restrained composition, and symbolic elements such as the setting sun and fallen game against a winter landscape. Farny records the Native American world coming to an end as technology encroaches upon his wilderness environment. ",
