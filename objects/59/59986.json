  "text": "In bamboo painting, an emphasis on brushwork and its relation to calligraphy is a chief concern. This type of stylized depiction favors expressionism over realism, a value central to the literati tradition. Ch'u Ying-shao, a Shanghai painter of the Tao-kuang period (1821-1850), was perhaps best known for his role as a designer and engraver of I-hsing teapots. The Mr. Li-tang, for whom this scroll was painted, was Chu Wei-hsieh, a close associate of two other well-known I-hsing designers and engravers, Ch'en Man-sheng and Kuo-lin. Literati circles often included artists skilled in more than one art form and a bamboo painting like this, while formulaic in theme and composition, would have been a treasured gift within this cultured group of friends.",
