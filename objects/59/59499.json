  "text": "<I>Huipiles</I> from Chichicastenango exhibit a wider range of imagery than those from other villages; however, they are also among the most instantly recognizable. As evidenced in this example, they are characterized by the boldly appliqu√©d or embroidered sunbursts that encircle the neck opening.  When worn, the sunburst surrounds a woman's head, positioning her at the center of her universe. \r\n\r\nIn contrast to the man's ceremonial <I>traje</I> displayed on the adjacent mannequin, this ensemble represents women's everyday dress.  Her huipil would be neatly tucked into her long, wraparound skirt (<I>corte</I>) and secured by a colorful sash (<I>faja</I>). Although the ikat-patterned corte fabric was woven on a treadle loom, the embroidered seams (<I>randa</I>) and sash were carefully made by hand in a skillful expression of color and pattern, visually related to those of the huipil.",
