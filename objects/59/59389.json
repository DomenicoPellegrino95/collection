  "text": "Elizabeth Olds was one of the first American artists to use silkscreen-traditionally a commercial process-for fine art. It was the late 1930s and Olds was working for the Works Progress Administration's Federal Art Project in New York City. She was among a handful of artists whose experiments made silkscreen a workable medium for getting colorful, broadly appealing prints to the masses relatively cheaply. Olds' facility with portraiture is obvious in her original figure types.",
