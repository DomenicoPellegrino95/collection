  "text": "A pioneer of American Regionalism, Grant Wood was a figurative painter best known for his perceptive interpretations of life in rural and small town America. Though he created only a small number of editioned prints during his career, Wood was a masterful draftsman, whose refined drawings were effectively translated through the medium of lithography. In this image of an idealized Iowa farmstead, Wood presents a romanticized portrayal of the American farmer, independent and self-assured, as he surveys his rural domain with pride.",
