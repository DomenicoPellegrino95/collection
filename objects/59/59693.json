  "text": "Joel Shapiro came into prominence in the 1970s for his Post-Minimalist sculptures in which his arrangements of simplified geometric elements took on nearly anthro-pomorphic traits. In describing his work, Shapiro stated, \"I think that there are certain fundamental formal relationships that are profoundly human. Do they extend beyond your self' They must.\" In both his three- and two-dimensional work, Shapiro deftly exploits these formal relationships-between individual elements, between parts and the whole, and between space and surface-to create dynamic, powerfully suggestive works of art.",
