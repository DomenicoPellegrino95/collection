  "text": "Painter and printmaker Roy Lichtenstein adopted ceramics as a canvas of choice in 1966.  He designed a number of patterns for dinner services.  Like his paintings and prints, Lichtenstein's table wares employ the same pixilated shading as period advertisements and cartoons. As he noted, \"this sometimes gets into amusing contradictions between what is two-dimensional and what is three-dimensional.\"  Although intended for mass production, his plate designs were printed in limited editions; only 100 eight-piece place settings were produced for this line.",
