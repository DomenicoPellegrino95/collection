  "text": "George Bellows moved a lithographic press to his home studio in 1916, which gave him unusual freedom to experiment. He cajoled one of America's premier printers, George Miller, to stop by nights to help. This image of Central Park comes from their historic first year together. In mood it seems to reflect Bellows' natural introversion. Sadly, his brilliant printmaking-totaling 193 lithographs-lasted just nine years, until his untimely death following surgery for a ruptured appendix.",
