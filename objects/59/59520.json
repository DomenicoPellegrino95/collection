  "text": "The celebrated sculptor Lee Bontecou often uses forms she finds in the natural world—birds, fossils, fish—which, after persistent examination, she transforms into something wholly original. This monumental pastel, which she worked and reworked over sixteen years, is a meticulously composed symphony of colliding shapes—trapezoids and stripes, curves and peaks—that does not, on the surface, much resemble the ocean. Yet it conveys the sublime power of the sea. Dominated by a giant, powerful wave, it seems to reference Hokusai’s famous woodcut Under the Wave off Kanagawa, which also dissects a wave into units—dark vertical stripes and white curvilinear crests—against a soft gray and white sky. \r\n\r\nIf Bontecou had the Japanese print in mind, it was merely a starting point. Her pastel is a tightly structured, chiseled abstraction that shows her sculptor’s approach to her subject. Hokusai depicted a breaking wave towering over three small boats; Bontecou evoked the peril of the sea through sheer scale and menacing shapes.",
