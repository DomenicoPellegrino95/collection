  "text": "The perforated floral décor of this unusual jardinière probably grew out of the taste for \"cut-glaze\" floral decoration produced at numerous northern kilns during the twelfth-fourteenth centuries. A second vessel containing a potted plant would have likely been placed inside this perforated container. A lustrous dark-brown glaze has been applied to the walls of the vessel. The unglazed bottom of the interior bears a flower blossom painted in brown slip.\r\n",
