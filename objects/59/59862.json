  "text": "A monstrance is used to display the consecrated host during the Blessed Sacrament in a Roman Catholic church or in a procession for Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament.  This example, or a nearly identical one, was part of an award winning altar service shown by the firm of Poussielgue-Rusand at the London Crystal Palace Exhibition in 1851, an influential exposition of industrial arts from around the world.  \r\n\r\nThe <i>Art Journal Illustrated Catalogue of the Exhibition<i> describes Poussielgue-Rusand as one of the most extensive European manufacturers of chandeliers, chalices, and other ecclesiastical furnishings, and this monstrance is referred to as \"an elaborate and rich piece of workmanship of very elegant and novel design.\"",
