  "text": "The <I>Hamsa</I> (five) hand is a common motif in Jewish iconography but is not necessarily Jewish in origin. In fact, the open hand, often with an embedded eye, as a protective talisman against the \"Evil Eye\" dates back to ancient Mesopotamia.  In Arab cultures the symbol is known as the \"Hand of Fatima,\" a reference to the Prophet Muhammad's daughter. The Hamsa symbol has spread in popularity as a good luck symbol for many cultures.",
