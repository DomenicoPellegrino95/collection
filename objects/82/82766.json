  "text": "It is extremely rare for an ancient inkstone to survive with its fitted box, and this example, with its silver pedestal base and cover is a testament to the high status accorded writing implements by China's scholar class.\r\n<P>The stone used here for the grinding palette is the fine-grained, purplish-gray tuan stone from Kwangtung province in south China. It is carved in the outline of the wind character (<I>feng<I>) with a flat, grinding surface sloping down to a water well enclosed by a raised border. This shape is also referred to as the \"winnowing basket\" shape and it was a popular inkstone throughout the T'ang and Sung dynasties (618-1280).\r\n<P>The lidded pedestal base is pierced on all four sides with wide oval openings of ogee-bracket form. It, and its domed cover, is fashioned entirely from sheet silver. Silver and gold utensils were popular amongst T'ang and Laio aristocracy particularly for special items. A similarly shaped inkstone and lidded pedestal base are clearly illustrated in the famous mural paintings in Chang Wen-tsao's tomb, excavated between 1974 and 1993 in Hopeh province and dated to 1093.\r\n",
