  "text": "The Kamo River runs through the heart of Kyoto, Japan's ancient capital. During the summer months, restaurants and brothels located along the river's edge were a popular destination for nighttime revelries since cool breezes from the river brought relief from the heat. This print shows a traveler en route to just such a destination, seen here from the far side of the river. Despite its small size, the printer has carefully produced subtle gradations of delicate pigment.",
