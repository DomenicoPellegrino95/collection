  "text": "This colorful and detailed painting illustrates the Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine festival held in mid-April. Shinto_ deities associated with the shrine are believed to protect nearby Mt. Hiei, shown here in the third panel from the left. During the festival, participants carry seven consecrated <I>mikoshi<I> (portable shrines) from Hiyoshi Taisha to Sakamoto, on the shores of nearby Lake Biwa, where they load them and sacred shrine horses into waiting skiffs. A boat race ensues to the far side of the lake. This screen shows the race in progress, with four of the sumptuously lacquered <I>mikoshi<I> with bell-shaped roofs visible in the boats. Colorfully dressed participants row the boats and beat drums while a crowd of people cheer them on from the shore.",
