  "text": "Erotic books were commonly published on a miniature scale--their diminutive size suitable to private or clandestine viewing. Such books often began with somewhat tame depictions of lovers, but quickly progressed to more graphically pornographic images. This print illustrates two lovers, presumably enjoying just such an erotic book. Their bedding is suggestively disarrayed on the far right, while a decorative screen affords them some privacy from the other visitors to the inn.",
