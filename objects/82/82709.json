  "text": "Ohara Sho_son studied the Shio_ school mode of painting, in which birds and animals were depicted in a closely observed manner within naturalistic settings. On the suggestion of the American art expert Earnest Fenollosa, Sho_son began to design woodblock prints to meet the great demand for such images among American and European collectors. Despite the small size of this print, Sho_son carefully rendered the scaly texture of the crane's legs and the variety of feathers that cover its body.",
