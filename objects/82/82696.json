  "text": "This print served as one of two frontispieces for a two-volume set titled <I>Books of Japan: 55 [poems]<I> by Henjo_ (<I>Yamato bunko 55 Henjo_ no maki<I>). The inner leaves, designed by Kunisada's pupil, were printed in black-and-white. Henjo_ (816-890) was a Zen monk of aristocratic birth who became one of Japan's six most revered poets. This print illustrates a court woman in an elaborate costume typical of those worn by aristocratic ladies when Henjo_ lived. Since Kunisada died in 1864, it is likely that the frontispiece was published posthumously.",
