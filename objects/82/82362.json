  "text": "As a young artist, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec enjoyed depicting outdoor scenes, especially those with horses. Later in life, he frequented the racetrack at Longchamp in the Bois de Boulogne, identified here by the windmill in the background. In the spring of 1899 during a three-month stay in a psychiatric clinic, he started work on a series of lithographs with a racing theme. This lithograph was the only one published before his premature death. It captures the power and energy of the horses as they speed toward the finish line.",
