  "text": "The form of this thin-walled, hand-built basin follows a Pan-po-type shape of the Yang shao culture that was already in use nearly a thousand years before this vessel was made. The wide rounded bowl has a fairly small flat base and an everted rim with a broad, rounded rim flange. Typical of much Ma-chia-yao ware, it is made of yellowish-brown earthenware, extensively painted in overall concentric and spiral patterns. It is exquisitely burnished imparting a rich luster to its interior surface.",
  "description": "thinly potted circular form with steeply rounded sides resting on flat rimless foot; painted black in linear design of concentric rings encircling round \\\"eye\\\" in center with two bands of arcs around the well above and below a central divider of three horizontal lines; everted rim, decorated with multiple \\\"eyes\\\" separated by clusters of oblique lines and one sector of crosshatched lines; exterior painted with three long wavy-line motifs, each ending with a curled-back hook and joining to form a continuous frieze below the rim; burnished overall to a smooth surface",
