  "text": "This drawing is a design for a small, round stained-glass window. Such panes bore images made up of outlines and tonal shading, typically in an amber yellow color. Highly finished drawings like this one may have been shown to a patron before work began on the glass itself. \r\nSaint Jerome (c. 347-420) led a dissolute life until he repented and withdrew to the simplicity of the wilderness. In later life, he entered a monastery, where he turned to scholarly pursuits, including translating the Bible into the Latin vernacular. In the present drawing we see him as a gaunt, elderly scholar in a monastic setting. He is accompanied by a lion who became his protector after he removed a thorn from the beast's paw, a scene just visible in the background. \r\nThough the image is relatively austere'in keeping with its subject'its slightly jarring combination of late-Gothic style with opulent Renaissance motifs is characteristic of the Antwerp Mannerist aesthetic.
