  "text": "The Incarnation of Mount Akiba in Echigo Province is commonly portrayed as an interrelated deity, with elements of the Shintoist tengu and the Buddhist Wisdom King Fud' My''. Like Fud', he is dressed as a Buddhist monk and holds a double-edged sword and a rope. Tengu are fierce, long-beaked, winged goblins with a bird's face and a human body, and are believed to derive from the Hindu eagle deity Garuda. The Incarnation of Mount Akiba rides on a white fox, flying through the sky, and is worshipped for his power to prevent fire.",
