  "text": "Perched happily in a tree is the Chinese monk Daolin, who was said to have meditated in the treetops with such stillness that the magpies built their nests around him. Below him, the celebrated Chinese poet Bai Juyi hangs his head in puzzlement. Bai Juyi had asked the monk to instruct him in the teachings of Buddhism. Daolin told him, “Abstain from doing evil and practice good deeds.” Frustrated, the poet responded, “Even a 3-year-old child knows that.\" Daolin replied, “A 3-year-old child could say it, but even an elder in his eighties cannot practice it.”",
