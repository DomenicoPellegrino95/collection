  "text": "Underneath the shadow of cloud encircled mountains, a hermit lives a solitary life amidst the trees.  This theme has a longstanding tradition in Chinese painting, reflecting the ideal of many educated people to retire into nature for self-cultivation and study.  Some retired for religious, particularly Daoist, ideals, while others retreated in disgust from the vicissitudes of professional life.  At the bottom left-hand corner, a fellow recluse makes his way up the winding road to visit his friend, an artistic device that offers us entry into the ideals of eremitism.     ",
