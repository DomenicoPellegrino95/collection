  "text": "The 100 plates in Jan de Bisschop’s Signorum veterum icones illustrate a comprehensive survey of the antiquities most celebrated in the 17th century—the Apollo Belvedere, the Hercules Farnese, the Laocoön, the Sleeping Ariadne, and many other renowned works of art. Published in the Netherlands in 1668-1669, this influential drawing manual introduced aspiring northern artists to the canon of Western art, which was predominantly Italian, and thus, except for the lucky few who could travel to Italy, was largely known through prints and copies. De Bisschop, who probably never went to Italy, collaborated with draftsmen like Willem Doudijns and Pieter Doncker who had traveled there. Several designs, however, were provided by artists who had not seen the works firsthand, including De Bisschop, leading to a distinctly northern presentation of some classical works, like, for instance, the Venus de’ Medici (plate 49). \r\nDrawing manuals like these were common teaching tools for artists and amateurs alike in the period, as drawing instruction began with learning to copy prints and drawings.
