  "text": "Mason was born in Princeton, Massachusetts in 1764. After graduating from Harvard University, he became a minister and in 1798, secured a job as the first Unitarian pastor of the First Parish Church in Castine, Maine. In addition to ministering, Parson Mason was also active in his community, serving on the school committee and as town treasurer. During the War of 1812, the town of Castine was seized by the British. Parson Mason was selected to carry the white flag of truce to the enemy’s warships; according to family tradition, the flag was his wife’s best linen tablecloth nailed to a six-foot oar.",
