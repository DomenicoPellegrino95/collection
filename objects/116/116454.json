  "text": "This striking and strange drawing is almost boastful in its rapid execution and imaginative conception. It is attributed to Giulio Benso, a talented follower of the celebrated Genoese artist Luca Cambiaso. Benso was an internationally successful painter and noted draftsman in his own right. Like Cambiaso, his pen drawings are bold and calligraphic in handling. This study represents the allegories of Chastity, Obedience, and Poverty, the three particular religious vows of St. Francis, suggesting the work relates to a Franciscan project. ",
