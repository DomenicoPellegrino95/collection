  "text": "Rendered in varying shades of black and gray, this work shows Fukuda Kodōjin’s extreme use of spatial contrasts. By employing different angles for foreground, center, and background, he creates a complex composition with multiple vantage points.\r\nAlong the rocks I search for fish \r\nwhere water’s clear and shallow;\r\nBeyond the clouds I hear the birds\r\nwhere trees spread in profusion.\r\nI go out my gate to enjoy myself,\r\nthen return back home;\r\nAs setting sunlight shines through the window\r\nagain I read my books.\r\n(Trans. by Jonathan Chaves)",
