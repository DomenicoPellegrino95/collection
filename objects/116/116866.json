  "text": "J'ry''s paintings of clean-cut beauties wrapped in luxurious kimono became very fashionable, and his influence can be seen in similar paintings even today. The left scroll represents a maiden from Kyoto, troubled that the hem of her robe is blowing in the wind, while the right scroll depicts a boy sneaking a peek, as though his powers of observation have stirred a wind strong enough to pry open her kimono.\r\n\r\n(with 2013.29.111.1)",
