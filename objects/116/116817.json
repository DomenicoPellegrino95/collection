  "text": "Against a fundame (matte gold) ground, medallions of different floral motifs are executed in slightly raised maki-e against black lacquered cut-outs sprinkled with kinpun (fine gold dust). The signature on the bottom of the case reads Yōyūsai, which could refer to Hara Yōyūsai (1772–1845), a highly revered lacquer artist in Edo, who would often base his designs on the paintings of his friend, the Rinpa artist Sakai Hōitsu. However, it is more likely that this inrō was made by another lacquer artist who worked under the same name during the second half of the 19th century.",
