  "text": "Munich artist Franz Stuck was one of Germany's leading artists of the Symbolist and Art Nouveau movements. He rose to such prominence that he was ennobled in 1905 as Franz Ritter von Stuck. Though best known as a painter and sculptor of images based on mythological heroes, he occasionally explored other avenues. In this early work, one of just a handful of etchings that he produced, a calm pool of water reflects nearby trees on its surface. Though completely different from the work that would make him famous, it does reveal the young artist's sensitivity to nature. ",
