  "text": "Daiitoku Myōō, the Wisdom King of Awe-inspiring Power, is shown with six faces, arms, and legs while riding on a water bull. These are wrathful, ferocious deities with mythical knowledge that can help overcome earthly passions, aiding enlightenment. Deities like this came from India along with Esoteric Buddhism, Daiitoku being derived from the Hindu death god Yamantaka. This Daiitoku is among the few surviving sculptures representing this deity.
