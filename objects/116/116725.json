  "text": "Daiitoku Myōō, or Wisdom King of Awe-Inspiring Power, is a Buddhist guardian deity whose intense rage is manifested by his wild appearance: six legs, six arms carrying an assortment of weapons, and six glaring faces backed by an aureole of flames. Derived from the Indian deity Yamāntaka, the “Conqueror of Death,” Daiitoku Myōō vanquishes evil along with his vehicle, a powerful water buffalo. He is one of the Five Great Wisdom Kings (Godai Myōō), four of whom occupy positions in each of the cardinal directions around a central deity known as The Immovable Wisdom King (Fudō Myōō). Each of the Wisdom Kings also guards its own Buddha. Since Daiitoku occupies the west, he is associated with the wrath of Amida, whose paradise is located in the west.",
