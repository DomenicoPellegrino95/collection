  "text": "Cloelia was among a group of young Roman men and women held hostage by the Etruscans when she led a dangerous escape by several of the women. One account says that she led them on horseback, crossing the Tiber River under an onslaught of spears. Cloelia was returned to the Etruscans when their king threatened to attack if she were not, but when she was back under his power, the king was so impressed by her bravery that he freed her and allowed her to pick other hostages to take home. As Battista Franco suggests in this drawing, she chose the young men, for they were the ones most likely to suffer in enemy hands. Franco appears to have made the drawing while at the court of the Duke of Urbino, who asked him to design scenes from Roman history for a large ceramic table service that he wanted to present to Emperor Charles V.",
