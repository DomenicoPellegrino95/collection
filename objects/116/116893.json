  "text": "The 6th-century Indian monk Daruma, known in Sanskrit as Bodhidharma, is credited with founding the Zen school of belief in Buddhism. Kak', who trained in Zen himself, stayed true to established iconography by representing him with large, round earrings and an exotic 'hairy' appearance while adding a minimalist, meditative sensibility.
