  "text": "An arrangement of crimson poinsettias resembles a “Calaveras” (or sugar skull), suggesting the vibrant colors and rich religious traditions of Mexican culture. Below, a black-and-white screenprint of photographs taken by the artist is collaged with other pictures that he found in Mexico City during his global art tour known as ROCI (Rauschenberg Overseas Cultural Interchange). Made with local craftsmen and materials, the piece explores Mexican visual culture and implies that local artistic communities and traditions offer dialogues that can transcend cultural differences.",
