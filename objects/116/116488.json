  "text": "This painted scroll depicts the life of Pabuji, a deified folk hero from 14th century Rajasthan, India.   A storyteller priest would have unrolled the scroll in the presence of a small audience and narrated Pabuji’s life through prose, song, and musical instruments, while pointing to the images as his guide.  Thus one cannot understand the meaning of this work of art without acknowledging its performative dimension.  Because the hero of the story is also revered as a regional god, the performance would have been imbued with ritual significance.  \r\n \r\nThe larger figurative representations feature Pabuji in profile, framed by multiple windows, while many of the complex scenes depict Pabuji as the victor of battles. Since the time of this work's original creation, the number of traveling storytellers in India has decreased dramatically.",
