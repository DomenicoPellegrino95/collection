  "text": "This pair of hanging scrolls is attributed to Yan Hui, an artist active in the 13th century when the Song dynasty fell to Mongol invaders from the north. As a professional painter, Yan Hui was adept at painting landscapes and flower-and-bird themes, but he was especially known for his figure paintings of religious subjects. Here he depicts Sakyamuni (left), an 5th century Indian prince whose teaching form the underpinnings of Buddhism; and Bodhidharma, the 6th century Indian sage who advocated meditative practices as a means of achieving spiritual enlightenment. Yan’s choice of red for the robes of both holy men not only provides a visual connection between the two paintings, it also hints at the spiritual bond between these two pillars of Buddhism. On the other hand, he masterfully conveyed something of the personalities of his subjects: Sakyamuni’s quiet, introspective character is suggested by his downcast eyes and gently inclined head, whereas Bodhidharma’s aggressive nature is conveyed by his direct gaze. \r\n ",
