  "text": "This medicine container (inrō) shows two sets of delicately rendered birds sitting on the branches of a blossoming cherry tree. Though the background has dulled with age, at one point the bright silver (ginji) ground would have shone vividly. This was achieved by coating a granular dusting of silver onto the wet lacquer, and once dried, grinding and shining the surface. The gold maki-e detailing in the blossoms of the cherry trees and inquisitive eyes of the birds offers a striking contrast to the dusk background.",
