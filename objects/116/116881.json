  "text": "Fukuda Suikō was born in Kyoto where he worked as a print designer and painter, and regularly contributed works to the Exhibition of the Ministry of Education (Bunten later Teiten). Birds painted in a realistic and traditional style were Suikō’s predominant subject.\r\nThis particular screen captures the so-called ‘Three whites’ (sanpaku), a popular painting maxim depicting three elements of white color such as snow, white plum blossoms, or birds. In this case it depicts a goose pursued by a falcon against a wintery background. The goose tries to escape, but the falcon in the opposite corner follows it at a steep angle, creating a strong diagonal movement across the screen. The whole scene is scattered with heavy snowflakes, in the foreground accented with the pastose application of white calcium carbonate pigment, known as gofun. The grasses and branches with red berries in the lower right corner also correspond with the winter theme.",
