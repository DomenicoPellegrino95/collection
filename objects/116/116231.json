  "text": "As the sun peeks over the distant horizon, Christ rises from the dead in a burst of light, startling the soldiers who had been sleepily guarding his tomb. They must have found the angel hardly less surprising. In the background, we see the three crosses of Golgatha, and the three Marys who have come through the gate on their way to visit the tomb.\r\n \r\nThough Joos van Winghe is not well known today, during his lifetime his works were avidly sought by cardinals, dukes, and even the greatest art collector of the time, the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolph II. In this rare drawing—less than twenty are known—one can see the combination of elegance and energy that attracted so much interest. ",
