  "text": "In his later years, Dengai S'sa (1607'75) was the head priest of T'kaiji Temple in Edo (now Tokyo), affiliated with the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism. The master-pupil relationship is highly valued in Zen Buddhism, which instructs that enlightenment can only be achieved through meditation, with teachers passing on the appropriate practice. When a pupil had mastered this practice, a chins' (ritual portrait) was created, representing the master's teachings and the student's induction into the lineage. Drawn four years before he passed away (or entered nirvana, following Buddhist beliefs), Dengai wears a formal brocade known as a kesa over his robes and holds a monk's staff.",
