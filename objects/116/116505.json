  "text": "A contemporary of Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci (1560-1609), was one of the leading artists in Italy in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, and perhaps the most influential. After establishing an art academy in Bologna with his older brother Agostino and cousin Ludovico, Annibale moved to Rome in 1594, where he executed the celebrated frescoes in the Galleria Farnese, a touchstone for generations of subsequent artists. \r\nDrawing was fundamental to the Carraccis’ artistic output. As one biographer, Malvasia remarked, “While eating they would draw, with bread in one hand and chalk or charcoal Annibale in the other.” Annibale was the most brilliant and natural draftman in the family. He drew to see, to think, to invent, to teach, to work, to joke, and to show off. \r\nThis study of three putti, executed in Annibale’s favored medium of black chalk on blue paper, dates from his Roman period and might relate to his painting Sleeping Venus (Musée Chantilly, Chantilly, France), which he executed for his principal Roman patron, Cardinal Odoardo Farnese around 1602. The painting features countless putti frolicking around Venus’s bed, engaged in various activities. The large winged putto in the study, shown pulling drapery with his left hand, might represent a discarded idea for the putto in the painting who appears to hide in the goddess’s bed curtains. ",
