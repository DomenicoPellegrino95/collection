  "text": "\"' it was only with Beethoven that [music] began to discover the language of pathos, of passionate desire, of the dramatic events which take place in the depths of man\" (Friedrich Nietzsche, 1874). The intense fields of dark red and off-white color, and the composer's agitated face suggest the emotional impact, and the abyss of violence sometimes opened up by Beethoven's music. This relief was made at the height of Beethoven-mania in Europe. Like certain pieces of Beethoven's music, Stuck's sculpture appears to be awe-inspiring and scary, violent and powerful at the same time.",
