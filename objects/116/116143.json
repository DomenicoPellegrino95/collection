  "text": "For this leaf, the artist shows a boat just as its oarsman poles it into view. An old gentleman sits in the prow, gazing into the distance. His hat is of a kind associated with Su Shi, a renowned Northern Song poet and statesman and also a popular theme of Chinese painting, but it would probably be a mistake to think that the leaf illustrates any particular poem by the poet. Rather, the Su Shi reference turns the passenger into an emblem of poetic sensibility. It is a painting of so-called yuyin (“reclusion in a fishing boat”), a theme concerning eremitism rather than fishing. Those seen on boats are not fishermen but scholar-recluses who are escaping an official career, fame and other social burdens.",
  "description": "two men in a boat--one standing, one seated; seated bearded man at left wears a grey cap and holds up a white fan; hunched-over standing man at right has white hair and wears a straw hat; basket with orange fruits in boat; plants at bottom, center and right",
