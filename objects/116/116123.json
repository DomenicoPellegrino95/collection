  "text": "The classical hero Hercules was legendary for his strength. He defeated many ferocious beasts, such as the lion whose skin he wears like a toga. Guercino—the cross-eyed artist nicknamed for his squint—shows the hero turning slightly, his powerful body flexing with the contained energy of a coiled spring. The shadows over his eyes leave us to guess the moment when he will tense, and swing the club from his shoulder. With a dazzling array of pen strokes, ranging from delicate and precise to loose and suggestive, Guercino, one of the most prolific and celebrated Italian draftsmen of the 17th century, treats us to his display of controlled energy.\r\n",
