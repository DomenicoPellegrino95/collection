  "text": "The lion skin around Hercules’ shoulder and waist is a tour de force, drawn with long, seemingly formless pen strokes that artfully abstract and utterly enervate the once fierce Nemean lion. Marvel, too, at the sinuous contour lines defining Hercules’ tightly muscled abdomen and biceps. By contrast, Guercino described Hercules’ facial features and expression with short, tight strokes, producing a superb character study of roughened, hard-bitten, stubborn manliness.\r\n\r\nGuercino is among the most celebrated draftsmen of the 17th century. A successful painter, he kept his drawings largely to himself in his lifetime. They became prized works of collectors only after his death. He drew frequently, instinctively, and compulsively, using his quill pen to visualize, to think, to\r\nproblem solve, to invent, and to have fun. This sheet, executed in pen and ink—his most natural medium of expression—embodies all the freedom, force, and finesse of his drawing style.",
