  "text": "Eugène Delacroix, the leader of the French Romantic school of painters, was also active as a printmaker. Blacksmiths were a recurrent theme for Romantic artists. They showed man as a modern-day Vulcan, harnessing the elements of fire and earth for god-like creation. Focusing tightly on the heroic individual, Delacroix emphasized the blacksmith’s powerful physique. Light emanating from the white-hot iron illuminates the man’s shirt and sets his skin aglow.\r\n \r\nThe light, heat, and power that throb from this compressed image are particularly strong in this example of Delacroix’s painterly aquatint, for this is an exceptionally fine impression—in fact, this is the earliest known impression taken from the copper printing plate. In making the image, Delacroix brushed a resistant varnish onto the plate in seven or more successive stages, exposing it to acid between each application. The stages can be seen in the test strips that surround the image in this trial proof. The strips were burnished out prior to the printing of commercial editions.",
