  "text": "The warp-faced leno weave structure is very unusual and is produced by only one mill in the world.  Few designers have the skill to successfully utilize this exceptional construction, but the Larsen design team worked with the Scottish weavers to develop several distinctive upholstery fabrics.  The 'masculine' quality of the fabric gave it a natural appeal for executive offices created by architectural design firms and its durability and relatively light weight made it particularly popular for use in both private and corporate aircraft.",
