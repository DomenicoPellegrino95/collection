  "text": "Of all Larsen designs, this is the most painterly in its effect.  Paul Gedeohn's\r\n inspiration for the original watercolor were photographs that Jack Larsen had taken\r\n of a famous European iris garden. The watercolor effect of the fabric is a tour de\r\n force of print technology that is enhanced by the weave and finish of the ground cloth. \r\n",
