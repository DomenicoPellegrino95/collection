  "text": "Many designers have worked with the company throughout its history. Only one, Lori Weitzner, collaborated with the studio on three consecutive collections. <I>Solace</I>, introduced as part of the Simply Grand collection, was created as an upholstery fabric. The pattern was popular during the 1990s and used in a number of unexpected ways, from wall covering for a ballroom in Asia (requiring 300 yards) to fashion wear. This sample is the largest in the collection; five-inch swatches represent the other colorways.",
