  "text": "The tulip has been a favorite flower of gardeners and textile designers for centuries. In the 17th century the Dutch mania for this Turkish hill flower made it a very desirable bloom in European gardens. Jack Larsen often uses masses of a single type of flower to create a particular effect and this year he planted 20,000 bulbs at LongHouse.<P>\r\nGardens take time to mature and this is often true of textile designs. As can be seen on the border of this panel of <I>Tuplimania<I>, the fabric was screenprinted in 1972. The design wasn't actually copyrighted until 1978, however, and wasn't available in the company's showrooms until 1981. \r\n",
