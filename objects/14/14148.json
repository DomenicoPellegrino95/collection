  "text": "The development of armor parallels the development of warfare and fashion.  As arms makers devised increasingly effective weapons like the mace and the crossbow, the armorer endeavored to provide his wealthy clients with armor that was both stylish and impervious to the latest threat.  16th century military strategy emphasized the cavalry charge with lance, followed by hand to hand combat with sword and shield.  A lance rest was installed on the breastplate to balance a heavy lance and to absorb the shock of a blow.  The sculptural form of the breastplate is fully functional, causing a sword or lance blow to glance off its surface.  The helmet's rounded form, flattened skull ridge and visor deflected blows to the head.  The bold, rope-like edges of the breastplate and gauntlets and the belted form of the breastplate emulated contemporary men's fashion, establishing the owner as a man of taste and means.",
