  "text": "Verdure tapestries have all-over designs of leaves, greenery, and flowers; higher quality versions may also include birds and animals. They range in style from intricate millefleurs (thousand flowers) designs to the repeating flowing acanthus leaf motif seen in this tapestry.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdure designs afforded weavers and buyers a certain degree of flexibility: they could be easily adapted to a tapestry of any size and the abstract nature of the design required less attention to precise delineation and complex shading, so weaving could progress relatively rapidly compared to designs that included human figures. All of these factors combined to make verdures available to a wide range of buyers, including small landowners and merchants as well as nobles and royals.",
