  "text": "Since the late middle ages large woven wall hangings have been used in much of Europe to create warmth and aesthetic distinction in the interiors of fashionable town and country homes as well as castles and palaces.  Designs ranged from the floral exuberance of the verdure style, seen here, to figural depictions of allegoric tales and historic events as seen in the tapestries installed in the museum's third floor grand hallway.\r\n\r\nFlemish law stipulated that tapestry workshops could create their own verdure designs and cartoons but they had to engage professional artists to design figured tapestries. Verdure designs could easily be adapted to a tapestry of any size and were often woven on speculation for sale in the marketplace. The abstract nature of the design required less attention to precise delineation and complex shading, so weaving could progress relatively rapidly compared to a figured tapestry. All these factors combined to make verdures affordable for a wide range of buyers, including small landowners and merchants in addition to the nobility and royalty who were more typical patrons.\r\n",
