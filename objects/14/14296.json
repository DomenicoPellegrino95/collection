  "text": "There were three styles of dragon robes reserved for the empress and the empress dowager. All had yellow grounds. The first and most common type displayed the nine imperial dragons against the usual cloud pattern in the upper register. This court robe represents the second style of <I>chi-fu<I> attire which consolidated the nine dragons into nine roundels against a plain, yellow ground. This style featured a wave pattern in the hem while the third style eliminates the wave pattern entirely.",
