  "text": "The <I>Portrait of Dogaressa Morosina Morosini<I> is considered to be from the Workshop of Jacopo Tintoretto, because Tintoretto likely did not paint any part of this work. There are various reasons as to why the painting came from the workshop without Tintoretto's touch, but all are speculative at present.  \r\n\r\nMany Italian Renaissance artists began their careers as apprentices in the workshops of established master artists where they learned the basic elements of their trade, such as grinding and mixing pigments and preparing panels or canvases. As pupils, the young artists would learn the skills of painting by copying works of the master. If truly talented, the pupil would be able to assist with important commissions by painting the background or other minor elements within the work. The purpose of the workshop was to educate and train artists; furthermore a master artist was able to expand his market due to his workshop. ",
