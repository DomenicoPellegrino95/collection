  "description": "Large vase (?), with shallow base-rim, almost barrel-shaped body and short neck; larger at base than top.  The pattern is painted in cobalt and green on the cream-colored pottery and covered with transparent pale-green glaze over all; around the center of the body is a wide band of inscription in blue with little leaf-like green dashes; above and below are rather naturalistic floral patterns.  Around the neck is a conventional pattern based on isoceles triangles.  Between each zone of ornament is a turquoise blue line.",
