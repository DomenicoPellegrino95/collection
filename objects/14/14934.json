  "text": "Folded in half and wound around the waist, the cummerbund style, this sash would add considerable girth, reinforcing the grand stature of the wearer. In addition, the elaborately woven pattern and costly metallic threads would communicate social status as well as wealth, all important messages in a society that valued ostentatious display as an indication of personal power.  \r\n\r\nThis sash represents the historic trade connections between Central Europe and the Middle East.  Although the fabric was woven in Persia, it was designed specifically for the Polish market. Later in the century, weaving centers in Poland, Lithuania and France began to cater to the Polish aristocracy and the wealthy merchants who favored this style.\r\n \r\n",
