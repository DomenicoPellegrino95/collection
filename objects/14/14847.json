  "description": "Lamp, low cylindrical form with three short legs, and cover.  The The sides have a series of oval medallions with the same naturalistic floral design on each with arabesque openwork between them.  The cover seems older than the rest and is certainly of a different style.  A man seated on his heels is engraved in the center with flowers around him; there is a border of openwork scrolled floral arabesque.  Chains inside and modern wire handle outside.",
