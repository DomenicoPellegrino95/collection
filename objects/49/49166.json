  "text": "Although Gaston de Latenay studied briefly at the Academie Julian in Paris, he was mostly self-taught. He had a long and successful career as a painter, lithographer, and etcher, and developed his own artistic vision apart from the various art movements of the day. However, his remarkable marine studies as well as his understanding of light-effects in the sky, storms, and rain influenced many Impressionist artists.",
