  "text": "Jousts were exceedingly popular in the Germany of Emperor Maximilian I, offering both combat practice and demonstrations of military skill. In the early sixteenth century several princes, including Friedrich the Wise, incorporated the spectacle into court festivities. Lucas Cranach records the mayhem of a joust Friedrich organized in Wittenberg: armor is flying, lances are broken, and one horse and rider are down. It is a far cry from the heroics of Samson and the lion depicted encouragingly on a banner on the back wall. The tiny scenes on the horses' garb refer to satiric themes of the day, such as the power of women to beguile men.",
