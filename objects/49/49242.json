  "text": "It is one thing to make a print; it is another to find a market for it. Collectors in German-speaking countries had a direct pipeline to the printmaking pulse through the Viennese art journal Die graphischen Künste (The Graphic Arts), published quarterly starting in 1878. Available by subscription, the luxury magazine carried original prints by some of the most gifted printmakers of the day, including Robert Sterl, August Brömse, and Käthe Kollwitz. Dozens of exceptional prints entered the Herschel V. Jones Collection through this publication, first through William M. Ladd and then when the museum continued subscribing until 1933.  ",
