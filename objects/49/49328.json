  "text": "After his baptism, the Gospels describe Jesus as wandering “the wilderness for forty days being tempted by Satan; and He was with the wild beasts, and the angels were ministering to Him (Mark 1, 13).” The desert provided Christ the isolation needed to purify himself through fasting and prayer. In the Bible, the desert recurs as a place of atonement and symbolizes humanity’s loss of the Garden of Eden, a reminder of Adam and Eve’s Original Sin.",
