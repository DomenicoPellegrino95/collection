  "text": "Martin Schongauer's importance to fifteenth-century engraving cannot be overestimated. His technical mastery is evident even in this early print, which depicts the Spanish Christians battling the Moors at Clavijo around a.d. 900. According to legend, the Christians were losing the fight until Saint James miraculously appeared to lead the Spanish army. The blank shield and unfinished rear of the fallen horse, near the severed head in the foreground, indicate that Schongauer never finished the plate, perhaps because he was disappointed by elements of the composition that display a certain clumsiness, such as the two heads suspended without horses next to Saint James.",
