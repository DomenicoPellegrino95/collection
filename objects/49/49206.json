  "text": "Beauford Delaney, a native of Tennessee, was one of many African-American artists who relocated to Paris where they felt their work could be judged on its merits, free from racial prejudices. The artist's style, highly-representational in his early career, became extremely abstracted in his later Paris years. <I>Jazz Quartet</I>, however, dates to Delaney's New York period when the artist was working in an expressionistic mode. Delaney's thick laying in of pigment also performs a synesthetic role in that the rhythms of jazz are evoked by the lively surface and rhythmic placement of forms. The heavily-textured surface also brings to mind the words of author Henry Miller, who recalled that the under-appreciated artist, though poor, was as lavish as a millionaire in his use of pigment.",
