  "text": "This design was inspired by the elaborate marble inlaid tables popular at the courts and homes of the elite in seventeenth and eighteenth century Europe. The sinuous interplay of diverse flowers and dragonflies embodies the same energy as the baroque style of the <I>pietre dure</I> decorative objects made by celebrated Italian craftsman. \r\n\r\nThe Larsen Design Studio spent more time on design development and refinement than most textile producers, yet they were keenly aware of total production costs. Archive records indicate that this pattern originally required twenty-four separate screens, or colors, but by using the salmon/rose color of the carnations for the centers of the white flowers instead of yellow and pale grey instead of a pearlized hue, 1,300 Swiss francs were saved.\r\n",
