  "text": "The inspiration for this image was a photograph. But instead of creating a drawing to represent the rhododendrons, Gedeohn edited the photo itself so the imagery could be manipulated into the repeating pattern.  \r\n\r\nThe coloration for many of Larsen designs was quite complex.  As can be seen on the outer edge of this panel, there is an alignment of nineteen small, colored circles.  Each circle represents a specific color needed to print this design.  When producing color variations of the same pattern, the designer will indicate a different range of colors to be used with the nineteen print screens needed to make this fabric. \r\n",
