  "text": "In the 1950s Larsen became well-known for fabrics that incorporated a variety of yarns and random repeats. Initially these cloths were hand woven, but demand eventually exceeded their production capabilities and a solution had to be found. Working with an Italian textile engineer who owned a small mill in New Jersey, Larsen was able to replicate these textiles using power looms.  Although it still proved to be much slower than the conventional power weaving of the time, it was much faster than hand weaving.",
