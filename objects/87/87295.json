  "text": "<I>Mimosa</I> was inspired by a Japanese carpet housed in the company’s Treasure Room* and is a wonderful illustration of how a textile designer’s skills can be used to successfully integrate many elements to create a fine textile.  The pattern was incorporated into two different cloths, one a rich chenille jacquard upholstery and the other a clipped supplementary weft neutral casement.  The use of materials, color range, structure and intended use of the cloths are entirely different and yet the pattern elements are essentially the same.",
