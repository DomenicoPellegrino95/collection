  "text": "The <I>Simply Grand Collection</I> was all the name implied, celebrating luxury and opulence, but shunning ostentation. The epitome of good taste, textiles for the collection were manufactured by some of the most sophisticated mills in the world.  \r\n\r\nWeitzner's work for Larsen continued the company's tradition of presenting collections that included a variety of textiles ranging from solids, stripes and simple non-intrusive repeat patterns, to graphics that were intended to make a strong statement.  Due to the size limitations of this gallery, each collection is represented by designs that were particularly popular and uniquely represent the spirit of the collection.",
