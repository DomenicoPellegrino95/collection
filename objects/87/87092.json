  "text": "<I>Magnum</I> is perhaps the most famous of all Larsen fabrics. Initially commissioned as the Symphony Hall curtain for the Phoenix Civic Plaza, the fabric was installed in 1972. Still in use, the curtain required 600 yards of material and replicates the boldness of the hand-embroidered mirror work of northwest India. Designers experimented extensively to find the ideal materials and technical adjustments of the mechanical embroidery equipment to create a stable fabric. <I>Magnum</I> was available in the original “flame,” this “golden topaz,” and several other colors until 1992.",
