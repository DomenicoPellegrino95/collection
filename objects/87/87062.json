  "text": "During the 1980s Paul Gedeohn developed a number of fabrics with complex\r\npatterns, wherein printed graphics were layered within woven imagery to\r\ncreate an integrated whole.  Working in Switzerland with both a print and a\r\nweaving mill, which were in close proximity and willing to collaborate on Larsen projects, allowed for a level of experimentation that was not usually possible.  \r\n\r\nIn the two color-ways we see here (Water Opal and Roselake), the threads\r\nwere first printed with a leaf pattern and then put on a loom that was\r\nprogrammed to weave a variation of the same graphic in a damask structure.\r\nThe intersection of the woven and printed patterns creates additional design\r\nelements.  This particular patterning system also creates a reversible fabric.  \r\n",
