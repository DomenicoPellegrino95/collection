  "text": "Color, an important element of every collection, helps create a specific mood and provides a unifying presence. The richness of the Larsen color palette has always been a company strength, and Larsen designers took particular care with color specifications when working with manufacturers.<P>\r\nThe company also drew on the psychological power of language when it named fabrics and colors. <I>Peking</I> and the colors “pigeonblood,” “puce,” “black pearl,” and “persimmon” suggest the exotic East, as does the fabric’s rich silk pile. That the fabric was actually woven in Torino, Italy, mattered little. Peking was first introduced in 1971, and by 1993, the line had thirty-one colors.",
