  "text": "<I>Primavera<I> was the first furnishings velvet produced by Larsen. Introduced in 1959, it became a popular design and was included in three different collections: Art Nouveau, Europe, and the Great Color of China. Although the pattern was officially discontinued in the early 1980s, its appeal was enduring and Larsen's successor, Cowtan & Tout, reintroduced it in 2005.\r\n\r\nLarsen formulated two new colorways for <I>Primavera<I> when it was included in the Great Color of China collection: Copper Luster and Jade Green, shown here. The green, periwinkle and celadon tones used in this colorway closly relate to the malachite and azurite pigments used on many of the Dunhuang murals.\r\n",
