  "text": "The album contains twelve paintings, each showing a scene representing a month of the year. The artist Ayaka Yu_shun studied under the prominent painter, print designer, and lacquerer Shibata Zeshin (1807-91). The highly naturalistic manner and the fine sense of composition seen in his paintings are the characteristics common to his mentorâ€™s works. However, his sensitivity to seasonal changes and his ability to find the beauty in the mundane make this album charming most.",
