  "text": "This bird-headed ewer belongs to a group of white wares which made their appearance in the Islamic world following the arrival of the Seljuks (1038-1194). Some of these thin, well made white ceramics imitate Chinese porcelain of the Sung dynasty as is apparent in the elegant pear-shaped body of this piece. It is difficult to assign a Chinese origin for the rooster-head with certainty, however. Ceramic bird-headed vessels existed in the Middle East before T'ang and the incessant trade that linked China, central Asian, and Middle Eastern Islamic countries was responsible for a great deal of cross-cultural borrowing and imitation. By the 12th century, the basic idea of bird-head decoration had become well established traditions in both China and the Middle East.",
