  "text": "The use of dark colors, such as deep purple, black, and blue-black, is a primary characteristic of Maya mourning huipiles, both woven and embroidered. The general layout of the garment is similar to the everyday huipil, but the imagery is simplified by the use of a monchromatic palette.  \r\n\tIn sharp contrast, the fanciful creatures and brilliant use of color on the everyday huipil suggests a lightness of spirit. Commercial cotton cloth forms the ground for both of these beautifully executed embroideries.\r\n",
