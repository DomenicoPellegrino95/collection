  "text": "MW: Omar Goldbeck was fantastic with his panoramic revolving camera. I’ve always liked this image and quite a number of his other images, like the group portrait of the 1926 Brooklyn Dodgers and of Babe Ruth and the Yankees in 1922. Goldbeck spent more than 40 years doing images of large groups of people. But this baptismal picture is so powerful. And I love the photographer—another photographer—behind the camera. ",
