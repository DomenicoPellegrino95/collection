  "description": "(According to seller): Handscroll by a Tosa artists of the early 17th century illustrating scenes from six Noh and Kyogen dramas. The painting is far more skilled than the best Nara [e] pictures of the period, and is probably the work of a master such as Tosa Mitsuoki (1617-91), or his father Mitsunori (1583-1638). The scroll is notable for its rich use of opulent coloring--much like the luxurious brocade robes used in the Noh drama itself. Modern brocade mounting is enclosed in wooden box.\r\n",
