  "description": "Late \"Fujiwara period\" ( 1086-1185), from Dainichi-do, Terai, Koga-gun, Shiga Prefecture.\r\nSeated wooden statue of Amida Nyorai, known as Golden Amida. Flesh originally covered with gold, much of which has disappeared. The robe is red with touches of green and black. The front edge of the skirt, the right arm, not including the hand, and the lower parts of the pedestal are not original. The mudra employed here is a form of an-i-in, here made by joining the indexes and thumbs.  A variation of this gesture can be used by six of the nine Esoteric Amidas of the so-called Middle and Lower classes. In this case the right hand  reposes on the left knee, palm upwards, signigifying the descent of Amida on the earth to seek the souls of the dead. It is one of the most frequently represented forms of Amida.\r\n",
