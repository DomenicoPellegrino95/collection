  "description": "unsigned; Fragment from a hakubyo Genji scroll illustrating poems (probably selected poems) of the Genji Monogatari. This fragment illustrates Wakana, pt. 2 and takes place at Sumiyoshi Shrine. It is nearly identical to the same scene in the Genji hakubyo scrolls in the Spencer Collection. Other parts of this same scroll are illustrated in the Tokyo National Museum catalogue of the Emaki exhibition, cat. 21 [Tokyo National Museum. Emaki. 1974]. There it is dated to the 15th century. This section illustrates three poems whose text in the Spencer scroll (vol. 4) are preceded by a single headnote. At the right is Genji about to send his poem by messenger to the Akashi nun. The second poem is the reply of the Akashi nun. The third poem is the reply of the Akashi lady (according to the text on which these scrolls are based. According to the standard Genji text the third poem is also from the nun). The figures are identified in writing. Although [a] nurse is identified she does not compose a poem or receive one. For the text see Seidensticker [translation of the Genji], pp. 594-595.\r\n",
