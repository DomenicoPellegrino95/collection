  "description": "The face of this work shows no seal or signature. However Ike-no Arina (pseudonym of Taiga) is discernable in the upper right reverse side of the paper. This poem is likely  the 1667th poem in the Mannyo-shu, the oldest Japanese Imperial Anthology. The poem is about a man who is seeking his lover, the precious bead which is said to be somewhere in the fathomless ocean. He asks the waves if they will bring the bead to him (MYS 1667):   imo ga tame  (I am searching for a pearl for my love) / ware tama motomu  (Bring closer the white pearls of the) / Okihe naru  (shore), / shiratama yoseko (Oh white waves of the open sea) / okitsu shiranami\r\n\r\nThe calligrapher appears to have written yokose rather than yoseko.\r\n",
