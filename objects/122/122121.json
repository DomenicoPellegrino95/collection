  "description": "Album of eight ink paintings on brown silk ( one with red touches) facing eight descriptive poems on decorated paper. Calligraphers identified in accompanying document. One of them died in 1710, others later.  Attribution to Tan'yu attested to by document dated 1713 and signed Kano Chikanobu ( 1660-1728), son of Tsunenobu, Tan'yu's nephew and successor.  1713 is the year Chikanobu became head of this branch of the family.  Seal is .9 by .9 and appears to differ from standard as shown in Tan'yu Shukuzu, vol. 2, p. 235, seal 3. This is not the original mounting. The calligraphies show signs of having been mounted elsewhere and the album formerly held larger paintings. Judging from the dates of the calligraphies they were done between 1700 and 1710.",
