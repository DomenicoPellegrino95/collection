The lid, now missing, would have continued the sectioned melon shape and was probably topped with a stem-shaped knob forming a loop, which would have allowed it to be threaded and connected to the pierced hole on top of the handle to prevent the lid from getting separated from the ewer. \r\n \r\n",
