  "text": "The bulbous body of this jar from Japan's Yayoi period was probably used to store liquids or grains. It swells from a small base and narrows at the neck, which supports a wide, flaring rim decorated with groups of vertical strips. The decoration and proportions of this jar are characteristic of pots first discovered in the 1880s at excavation sites near Yayoi-chō, the area of central Tokyo from which the Yayoi period takes its name.",
