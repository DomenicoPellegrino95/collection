  "text": "In the mid-1960s, Win Anderson, head of the Larsen Design Studio, developed a line of batik velvets. <I>Conquistador</I>, introduced as part of the Andean Collection, was particularly successful.  The \"tortoise\" color seen here was created by dying the cloth twice, first brown, and then after a wax resist was applied to create the pattern, the fabric was immersed in an orange dye bath.  \r\n\r\nThis embroidered and quilted example was featured in the Jack Lenor Larsen 1967 retrospective at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. For years the company presumed this unique banner was lost until it was rediscovered among the archive materials. The extensive Larsen company archive materials are now in the collections of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and the University of Minnesota. \r\n",
