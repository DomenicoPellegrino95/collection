  "text": "<I>Helix<I>, one of the new designs created for the Great Color of China collection,  \r\nreinforces the assertion that this collection was about color influence, not design influence, as its imagery was borrowed from ancient Celtic carvings excavated in New Grange and Knowth, Ireland. It is a direct descendant from an earlier fabric, <I>Oberon<I>,  which featured the spiral motif on a sheer casement cloth in the Irish Awakening collection. \r\n\r\nThree colorways of this sumptuous velvet batik were offered: Fawn, Rose Quartz, and Copper Luster. This example, Copper Luster, illustrates the foundation of Larsen's palette for this collection-a soft, pink-toned terra cotta that appears frequently in the Dunhuang murals. \r\n\r\n",
