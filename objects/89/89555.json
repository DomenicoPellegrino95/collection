  "text": "Thao’s The Hmong Migration is a cycle of 50 paintings chronicling the migration of Southeast Asia’s Hmong people, a saga that goes back thousands of years. As U.S. allies during the Vietnam War, the Hmong were targets of Communist persecution when American forces withdrew. Many Hmong were forced to leave their homes in Laos and cross the border into Thailand, where they were held for years in refugee camps. Many were later resettled in the U.S. Thao’s cycle was inspired by “story cloths,” textiles that are embroidered while living in a refugee camps. Thao has said, “I want the series to educate the younger generation, to have some closure with the generation that went through the war, and hopefully to become a historical document for generations to come.” ",
