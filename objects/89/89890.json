  "text": "The Hohokam were a sophisticated people with some of the best developed sociopolitical organizations in all of the ancient Southwest.  They did not construct tall buildings, living instead in pithouses dug into the ground, but they created an extensive and complex irrigation system of canals that made large-scale agriculture possible in their arid environment.  They also created vibrant two-toned ceramics in a wide variety of shapes and sizes.  Hohokam artists are particularly known for including spirals in their designs, as seen in this large bowl.  Their descendants, the O'odham, incorporated simillarly exuberant patterns into their art.",
