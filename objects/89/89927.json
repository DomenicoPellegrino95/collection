  "text": "Although it is unclear what the function of this object was and what the small containers in the sides held, it is an excellent example of the Yup'ik artistic tradition. In the Yup'ik worldview, there is a fine balance in the physical and spiritual worlds as well as the cosmos.  These beliefs are reflected here by the representation of the two faces; one with an upturned mouth, the other with a down turned one.  This typical Yup'ik duality exists between sky and sea, light and dark, and male and female.  The male face has a mustache and goatee; the female is illustrated by facial tattoos on the lower lip. The images have been placed back-to-back, showing that the opposites are meant to be together.  This type of imagery can also be found on wooden plaques that were attached to kayaks, which would insure safe passage.",
