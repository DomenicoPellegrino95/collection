  "text": "Kanzaki Shiho grew up in Shigaraki, one of Japan's oldest ceramic centers, but he was not particularly interested in ceramics until after he had graduated from Kansai University in 1963 with a law degree. Determined to become a ceramic artist, he lived for many years in abject poverty before he was sponsored and encouraged by the older, more established potter Suketoshi Matsuyama. After investigating the ancient Shigaraki and Iga pottery styles, Kanzaki developed his own techniques and ideas. Recently, he has produced pieces with uniquely textured surfaces, as shown on this large jar. ",
