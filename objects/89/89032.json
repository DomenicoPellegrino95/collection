  "text": "The wonder fabric of the 1960s was nylon knit; it was easy to wash, resisted wrinkling and therefore required little or no ironing and traveled easily. It was not beloved by all consumers, however, so the Ja-eL line sometimes used other fabrics.  Although not as easy to clean, wool jersey draped well and was easy to care for and therefore was used for some production.  \r\n\r\n<I>Castanet</I> was marketed in six different colorways, but was discontinued with the demise of Ja-el production.  <I>Minaret</I> and <I>Firebird</I>, renamed <I>Ballet Ruse</I> (on exhibit in the hall), were printed on a woven rather than a knit ground cloth and were included in the Larsen interiors line during the late 1960 and into the 70s.",
