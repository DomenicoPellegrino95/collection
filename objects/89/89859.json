  "text": "Towards the end of Japan's prehistoric Jo_mon era, early artisans began to shape small bowls and cups for individual use, although deep jars for ritual and storage continued to be made. Such vessels suggest the practical concerns of a more settled society as Japanese began to organize into larger communities. Despite its modest scale, this cup exhibits the distinctive \"jo_mon,\" or rope markings, after which the era was named. ",
