  "text": "A carp ascending a waterfall is a long-standing symbol of social ambition in East Asia, and is a frequent subject of Japanese artists. True to his own unique personality, Zeshin depicted this carp in an unconventional manner. Surfacing from the water, the fish looks like a friendly visitor rather than a determined social climber. Although the perspective is illogical, Zeshin shows the carp's reflection in the water behind it. The reflection's pale hues reveal the consummate skill of the printer.",
