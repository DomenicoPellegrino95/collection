  "text": "As with many of his Italian countrymen, Vico Magistretti was instrumental in changing the perception that plastic is a \"cheap\" and inferior material.  The \"Selene\" dining chair is one of the first generations of Italian all-plastic chairs.\r\n\r\nMagistretti resolved the technical difficulties associated with the strength of the legs by configuring them in an \"S\" shape.  The result is typical of his designs, informal, practical, yet infused with a sense of fun combined with functional simplicity.  The curved surfaces, glossy finish, and the irrepressible orange provide the kind of flair so often identified with the Italian aesthetic.\r\n",
