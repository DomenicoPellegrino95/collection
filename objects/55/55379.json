  "text": "Note the tight texture of the foliage on the left. It hardly looks like the work of Rembrandt, and indeed, it is not. It is the work of Hercules Segers, a highly experimental printmaker who captured Rembrandt's imagination. Rembrandt was so taken with Segers's art that he obtained one of his etched printing plates. In an act of creative vandalism, Rembrandt partially effaced the plate, removing Segers' figures of Tobias and his guardian angel. He then transformed the image into one of the Holy Family on its flight into Egypt. Look closely to find traces of the angels' wings.\r\n\r\nWhen the three wise men reported the birth of \"King of the Jews\" to King Herod, the king launched a plot to exterminate his infant rival. An angel warned Joseph in a dream, so Joseph led his family out of Herod's dominion and into Egypt. The subject fascinated Rembrandt, and he depicted it frequently.\r\n",
