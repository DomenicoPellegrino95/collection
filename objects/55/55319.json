  "text": "Rembrandt treated the subject of the Holy Family's Flight into Egypt several times. These three examples span the artist's career, and in each version he was particularly interested in achieving a convincing depiction of night. The images become progressively darker until, by the 1651 print, one can scarcely make out the three family members in the shadows. They are just barely visible in the soft light of Joseph's lantern.",
