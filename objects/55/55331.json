  "text": "Rembrandt had a great gift for conveying intimacy with just a few etched lines. Here he places the Holy Family in a setting of comfortable domesticity-so comfortable, in fact, that Mary has kicked off her shoe while nursing. In this fashion, Rembrandt humanizes the sacred to make it more accessible. ",
