  "text": "The viewpoint of this etching is from inside the gallery that runs along the fa√ßade of Notre Dame Cathedral.  Through the delicate stonework one can catch glimspes of the Law Courts and the Clock Tower in the distance.  The black birds that populate the prints <I>The Vampire<I> and <I>The Exchange Bridge<I> also appear in this work.  Scholars have suggested that these birds are actually ravens due to the fact that the same year that his print was completed also saw the publication of Charles Baudelaire's French translation of Edgar Allen Poe's poem <I>The Raven<I>.",
