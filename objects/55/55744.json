  "text": "Female nudes dominated Rembrandt's final years as a printmaker. All seem to be based on direct observation of the model, and exhibit intimate appreciation of reality and vulnerability. Here one can make out the back of a chair, but Rembrandt's thoughts wandered into the realm of fantasy, and he relocated his model to a waterside embankment.",
