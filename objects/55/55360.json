  "text": "His hair still tousled from sleep, young Joseph can't wait to share his dream, which foretells that his father and brothers will bow down to him (Genesis 37:5-11). Commanding center stage, he is too lost in his tale to notice his father's disbelief and his brothers' disdain. As their remarkably varied expressions imply, the brothers are moving ever closer to ridding the household of the precocious \"dream-master.\"",
