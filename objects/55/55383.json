  "text": "The subject of much interpretation, this print shows a scholar who stops work to watch a mystical vision hovering in his study. Through the vapor, a ghostly hand points to a mirror next to a glowing disk. In the disk's center are the letters INRI, the Latin abbreviation for \"Jesus of Nazareth King of the Jews.\" Early on, the print was given the title Dr. Faustus, referring to Johann Faust, the subject of German legends. Others think that the figure is an alchemist. Still others believe the man to be Faustus Socinian, a sixteenth-century religious figure who founded an Amsterdam-based sect that denied the existence of the Holy Spirit. ",
