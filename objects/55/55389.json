  "text": "A myth about Rembrandt is that he etched so many beggars-more than thirty etchings in all-because he felt alienated from society himself. It is true that he once portrayed himself as a beggar, but he was more attracted to the expressive faces, tattered clothing, and crumpled gait of these \"low\" subjects. Unusual for the time, Rembrandt gave his beggars real emotions and individualized faces, seemingly with a view toward stirring compassion in his viewers.",
