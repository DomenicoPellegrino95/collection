  "text": "In the two prints of Saint Jerome seen nearby, the lion appears in the darkness, his cool spot near the base of the tree. Here he has taken center stage, facing away from viewers, to protect the hermit saint from the wicked influences of civilization. \r\n\r\nRembrandt never traveled far from the flat Dutch landscape, yet here he placed Jerome in a mountainous Italian setting. The artist lifted the elaborate architecture of the distant buildings from Venetian prints and drawings produced more than a hundred years earlier; yet the ambiguity of the overall space anticipates the work of Paul CÃ©zanne two centuries later. The saint is immersed in a book as his trusted lion stands guard. Rembrandt's spare linework causes Jerome seemingly to dissolve in the noonday sun, a visual metaphor for the sacred realm.\r\n",
