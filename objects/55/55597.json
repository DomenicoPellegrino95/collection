  "text": "Even though he is her husband, Esther knows that to appear before the king without being summoned is punishable by death and has prepared herself by praying and fasting for several days.  Esther goes to the King's chamber and reveals Haman's evil plot to massacre the Jews as well as the fact that she too is Jewish.  When he becomes angry, Esther faints.  The French text goes on to say, \"At the same time God changed the heart of the king and inspired him to gentleness.  Suddenly he got up from his throne and held Esther in his arms and, believing what she had revealed to him, said, 'What is wrong Esther, I am your brother, you must believe me.\"",
