  "text": "Matisse was an obsessive artist. He would return to a theme dozens if not hundreds of times. At the close of World War II, he produced many sketches of faces, especially those of women. He would often have the sketches transferred to lithographic stones as a means of making his spare, elegant studies available to wide audiences.",
