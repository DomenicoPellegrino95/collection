  "text": "Protestant Europe loved the parable of the Prodigal Son because it so perfectly crystallized the Reformation doctrine that salvation comes to those who have faith. In the parable, a ragged son returns home after spending his inheritance on debauchery and sin. Amazingly, he is forgiven, simply because he believes in his father's mercy and love. Rembrandt's print shows servants bringing the repentant son new clothes, symbolic of his salvation, to put on before entering his father's house. ",
