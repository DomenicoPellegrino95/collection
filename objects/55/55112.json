  "text": "This print belong to a genre called tronies, or character heads-usually anonymous figures portrayed with penetrating expressions and fanciful costumes. Although artists made tronies primarily to practice facial expressions, collectors prized them for their inventiveness, evocative techniques, and convincing emotional depth. Scholars are fairly confident that the subject of Bust of a Man (Rembrandt's Father') is not the artist's father, because it does not resemble the one surviving drawing Rembrandt made of him.",
