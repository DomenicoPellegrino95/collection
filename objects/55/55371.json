  "text": "With Tobias safely home, the debt retrieved, and Tobit's eyesight restored, Raphael's mission is complete. He finally reveals his identity as he departs in a freely sketched flurry of clouds and drapery. Endowed with spiritual perception, only Tobit-and his wife, Anna-witness his departure, which so startles Anna that she drops her cane. In the Bible, just father and son are present at the leave-taking, but Rembrandt assembled the entire household, displaying his fondness for down-to-earth domesticity. Also taking leave is Tobias's dog, said to be the only dog given a specific role in the Bible. ",
