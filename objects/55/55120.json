  "text": "Here we see the same print in two different states, that is, from two different moments in the development of the printing plate. The first is a rich, early trial proof taken before Rembrandt had trimmed and smoothed the edges of the copper plate. Such rarities are highly prized by collectors. Rembrandt's final compositional solution increased the amount of the image devoted to his own face, thus pushing him more aggressively into the viewer's space.",
