  "text": "Ishiyama Temple is located on the southern end of Lake Biwa. According to tradition, Lady Murasaki began writing her famous novel, <I>Genji Monogatari<I> (Tales of Genji), while sequestering herself here in the 11th century. Seated on one of the temple's verandas, she apparently was inspired by the sight of the distant lake by the light of the full, August moon. Thus, for most Japanese, Shinsui's view of an empty, covered veranda at Ishiyama Temple beneath the full moon evokes associations to the famous author and her classic novel of courtly love.",
