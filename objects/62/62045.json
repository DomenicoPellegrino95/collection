  "text": "In 1963, Gerrit Rietveld created this chair for the Steltman Jewelry Shop in The Hague, as part of a total interior remodeling project.  Two chairs were initially made, a left- and a right-hand version, both upholstered in white leather.  This natural oak model, made by Gerhard van de Groenekan after Rietveld's death, is notable for its muscular, geometric abstraction.  Seen from any angle, the overall composition remains asymmetrical yet well balanced, each element contributing to a pronounced sense of spatial equilibrium.  In this last design, Rietveld reaffirmed his reputation as an inventive spirit, creating a chair that incorporates the same revolutionary qualities as the designs he made as a member of the Dutch De Stijl movement forty-five years earlier.",
