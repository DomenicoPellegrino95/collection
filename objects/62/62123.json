  "text": "The sgraffito technique popularly employed in Iran during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries was also used on contemporary Syrian and Egyptian vessels. In this method, a white slip (or engobe) covers a red body. After the design was incised, green and purple glazes were applied to designated areas and a transparent glaze was placed over the cream colored slip. With this technique, the glazes tend to run. Probably inspired by contemporary metalwork, the incised decoration features a central knot motif roundel within a border of arcaded panels between zigzag borders all filled with a cross-hatched ground and a band of scrolling designs around the interior walls.",
