  "text": "Yamakawa Shūhō was a painter, print designer, and illustrator from Kyoto who lived and worked in Tokyo. His paintings were accepted to an impressive 17 exhibitions organized by the Ministry of Education. Only a few woodblock prints by Shūhō exist and the series Women in Four Settings is considered amongst his best. Each image is associated with one of the four seasons. Here, winter is indicated by snow-covered nandina branches with red berries, a motif that decorates the woman’s blue kimono. \r\n\r\nThis print is featured in the MIA exhibition and publication \"Seven Masters: 20th Century Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Wells Collection\".",
