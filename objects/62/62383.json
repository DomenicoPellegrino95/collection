  "text": "Ma Lin (active c. 1180â€“after 1256), whose name appears in the red seal impressed on this painting, was the son of the great academy artist, Ma Yuan (active c. 1190-1225). Characterized by firm, expert brushwork, the composition and stylistic features of this painting place it clearly within the classical tradition of court painting that flourished in Hangzhou from the 12th to the early 15th century. The Ma family was then a leading proponent of the so-called Southern Song (1127-1279) landscape style and a series of court appointments kept members of the family in positions of artistic influence for over 300 years. The Daoist theme depicted here, of a lone scholar viewing the sunrise, is standard Southern Song subject matter. He reclines on a riverbank with bronze ritual implements arranged in front of him probably in preparation for ritual incense burning. The Daoist philosophy, with its emphasis on nature, was fundamental to the early development of landscape painting and nature poetry in China.",
