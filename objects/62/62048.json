  "text": "Early in her career Sheila Hicks lived in Mexico.  She was fascinated by the jaspe (ikat) dyers who bound groups of threads together in pre-determined sections as they made preparations for resist dying. This element of tightly controlled elements integrated with unbound sections is frequently seen in her work and reflect her desire for balance between careful planning and spontaneity in her life and her art.  \r\n\r\nDuring the third quarter of the twentieth century a number of artists who were drawn to fiber as a media and worked in large formats used elements such as rope and industrial bands whereas others created large scale \"threads\" in order to maintained a proportional balance with the completed object.\r\n",
