  "text": "This large, sumptuous fan, fashioned from ivory and decorated with painted silk, was probably produced for the export market. As domestic demand for ukiyo-e prints and paintings declined in the late nineteenth century, many traditional artists continued to make a living from their craft by supplying objects for the growing market abroad. Here, Kunihisa painted a riverside scene in pale tonalities showing fishermen with their poles and baskets, as well as a mother and child on an outing. ",
