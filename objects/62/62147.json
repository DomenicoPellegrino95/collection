  "text": "Miniature depictions of the Andean world, such as this llama, were often included in offerings, and were likely meant to represent the perfection only attainable in the otherworld. A spectacular group of Inka miniatures was glimpsed by Spaniards at the most holy shrine of the Inka, Cuzco's Coricancha (Temple of the Sun). There, the world was represented in golden miniature, from animals and plants to even the smallest grains of soil and sand.",
