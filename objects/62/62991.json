  "text": "The more studied approach to the depiction of this duck, as well as the overlapping of compositional elements suggests the stylistic influence of the Kano school on Hiroshige. However, the woodblock printing techniques that allowed the snowflakes to be rendered in negative reserve against graduated fields of blue and gray brings a novel freshness to the design. The haiku echoes the wintry mood of the scene:\r\n\r\n<P><I>Ducks cry and wind<I>\r\n<P><I>makes the ripples on the water.<I>",
