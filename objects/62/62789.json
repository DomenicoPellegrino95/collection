  "text": "Honored with the 1998 American Crafts Council Gold Award, and the 1999 McKnight Distinguished Artist Award, Warren MacKenzie has been working in Minnesota since the mid-1950s, creating functional and well-crafted wares. After graduating from the Art Institute of Chicago and apprenticing with the English potter Bernard Leach, MacKenzie and his wife Alix established a pottery outside Stillwater, Minnesota. His forms and decoration are influenced by traditional Japanese and Korean wares and the ceramics of Leach, and he has always insisted that his pots be available to everyone and be used every day. This simple yet elegant blue-glazed teapot with bamboo handle, as well as the other pots in this case, are typical of MacKenzie's functional wares.  While professor of art at the University of Minnesota, MacKenzie generously shared his knowledge of ceramics and encouraged many students, some of whom who have stayed in the area to make Minnesota a thriving and important center for the ceramic arts.
