  "text": "The production of wares with slip polychrome decoration on a colored ground seems to have taken place in northeast Persia at Nishapur as well as Samarkand in central Asia. This ware was created by applying a thin slip (or engobe) over the clay body under a clear glaze. The most common colored grounds are reddish-brown and dark brown. The interior of the bowl is decorated with a wide rim band of dotted circular motifs, an inscription in brown Kufic script around the caveto, and a simple, circular motif in the bottom.",
