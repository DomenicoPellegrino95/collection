  "text": "It was a mystery, an iron question mark. For more than 10 years after it was given to the museum, curators couldn’t determine Elmslie’s sculpture’s purpose. The only clues were the elegant curves of the seed pod and “lettuce leaf” designs, which suggested an ornamental origin. \r\n \r\nCurators recently discovered that it is a sample of decoration on the elevator bank at the Woodbury County Courthouse. Eleven of these designs appear on a large metal grille at the top of a two-story interior atrium at the courthouse. ",
