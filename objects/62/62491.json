  "text": "In the artist's book Death of Hektor, Hayter and Irish poet Brian Coffey (1905-1995) dramatically reinterpret Homer's epic tale from The Iliad. Rather than embrace the traditional view of Achilles as the embodiment of honor, glory, and fame, Coffey and Hayter portray the Greek hero-warrior as a violent and vengeful soldier-his mindless and brutal actions during and after the murder of the Trojan prince Hektor belying his tragic hero status. In this, they challenge the glorification of the culture of war-violence, destruction, and death-elevating the importance of a morally conscious Hektor, while stressing Homer's deep \r\ninsight into the human condition. \r\n\r\nHayter contributed a series of monochromatic and color prints for the collaborative project, some of which were printed at Atelier 17 in Paris.\r\n",
