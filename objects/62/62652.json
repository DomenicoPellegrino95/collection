  "text": "Robyn Horn is one of the most adventurous sculptors currently working in wood.  She is also a strong supporter of wood artists and was the founding president of the organization Collectors of Wood Art in 1997.  Though she began by turning vessels on a lathe in the 1980s, within ten years her work was moving off the lathe and into free-form sculpture.  She has recently been working on a monumental scale, employing a chainsaw to free complex forms from massive downed redwoods.  She holds abstract sculpture as her main visual inspiration, along with \"the nature of the material and its resistance to being changed.\"   With <I>The Scream<I> she translated into relief sculpture Edvard Munch's famous image of psychological torture, defining the figure through the grain and color of the wood and her characteristic chip-carved surface.",
