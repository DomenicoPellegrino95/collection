  "text": "Carved from precious hardwood with a dragon-head finial, this tall, walking staff would have likely belonged to a scholar-official. Walking sticks were habitually carried by literati recluses while enjoying nature, and they are often seen in landscape paintings. Taoist mythology included a tradition of magical staffs which transformed into dragons, and it might be that the dragon head carved at the top of this staff refers to the dragon transformation myth. Most walking staffs were simple pieces of bamboo or a gnarled branch, and no other carved huang-hua-li staff has been recorded.",
