  "text": "Tsukudajima is a manmade island at the mouth of the Sumida River. Fishermen who settled there from western Japan constructed a shrine dedicated to Sumiyoshi, the god of the sea. This print depicts the highlight of a festival held at the shrine every summer. The white banner in the center is emblazoned with the name of the Sumiyoshi god. Behind the banner, held by a number of naked men is a mikoshi, a portable shrine for transporting the spirit of the god. It is about to be placed in a boat and carried out to sea, symbolizing the god's return to his watery home. ",
