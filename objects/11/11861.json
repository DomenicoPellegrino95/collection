  "text": "The size of this seal as well as its inscription indicate that it was probably used to stamp official rather than personal documents. Several tortoise form seals have been excavated from Han tombs, suggesting that this animal, which symbolized longevity, was already a popular motif among the educated class. This seal bears the inscription <I>Tai-shou Chang lui Huai<I>. Lui Huai appears to be a place name meaning overlooking the Huai river, while Chang is the official's surname, and <I>Tai-shou<I> his official title.",
