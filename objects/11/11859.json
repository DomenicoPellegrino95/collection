  "text": "Ink stones began to be carved with decorative designs at least as early as Sung. This has a cover decorated in classic Sung style with an enframed hibiscus blossom. Relatively naturalistic, the design was likely inspired from similar themes found in contemporary album and fan paintings. Small double compartment inkstones such as this were often used to grind the colored pigments used in paintings.",
