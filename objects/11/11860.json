  "text": "A superbly modeled chimera comprises the handle of this tiny square seal whose legend, <I>Chen Shang hsin yi<I>, cast on the reverse in negative seal script, may be translated as the \"personal seal of Chen Shang.\" Small undecorated seals are known from the Warring States (480-221 B.C.) and Ch'in (221-206 B.C.) dynasties while more elaborate animal-shaped knobs were popular during Han as the use of official and personal seals became widespread. Seals with tortoise, chimera, ram, and camel-shaped knobs were popular and have been excavated from Eastern Han tombs. In spite of its extremely small size, the chimera on this example is exceptionally detailed and animated.",
