  "text": "When this figure was carved in Europe, around 20,000 BCE, the grounds of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts were still covered in glacial ice. That ice melted around 10,000 years later and the soil here began to form. \r\nIn this pre-agrarian, pre-patriarchal age, long before farming, settled society, and stationary homes, Paleolithic tribes crisscrossed present-day Europe, following the migration of animals and edible vegetation. When the climate was still cool and the glaciers were receding, someone carved this figure and carried it in her hand while walking across the land.  \r\nMonolith\r\nThese soils are from Northern Minnesota. The rocks are old but the soils are young, their development limited by the cold winters, mineralogy, and the relatively short time it has been exposed to weathering. These soils are not static but are incredibly diverse and always changing. Starting with the parent material the glaciers laid down, they respond to their surroundings, which includes climate, vegetation, topography, and human influence.",
