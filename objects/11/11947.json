  "text": "This small bronze is based upon a life-sized fountain figure of <I>Fiorenza</I> (a personification of the city of Florence), which the Flemish sculptor Giambologna made for the Medici villa in Castello near Florence around 1560. It is therefore possible that it is an early example of a Grand Tour bronze, brought back by a young nobleman from England or Northern Europe from his journey to Italy. Since Giambologna himself was inspired for the pose of his figure by an ancient statue type, which Titian had used in 1518-20 for his <I>Venus Anadyomene</I> (Venus Rising from the Sea), it is however possible that the unknown caster of this bronze intended to create the image of Venus--the Graeco-Roman goddess of love--drying her hair after she stepped ashore the island of Cyprus.",
