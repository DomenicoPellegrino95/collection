  "text": "After World War II, Austrian artist Oscar Kokoschka, traveled across Europe and the United States painting portraits and townscapes; including The Duomo, Florence. While the Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore, known as the Duomo, or cathedral church, has a façade of red, white, and green marble topped by red brick domes, Kokoschka uses an array of colors to capture the light playing off the exterior marble. The grandeur of the Duomo is portrayed by the inability of the building to fit onto this large canvas - the famous dome extends beyond the top of the scene. Kokoschka writes that this painting is, “my personal contribution to the vogue for cubism. The structure is broken down into hundreds of facets, each with its own colour. This was to show how to go about letting colour rather than geometry determine a picture.”\r\n \r\nA few years after completing The Duomo, Florence, Kokoschka traveled to Minnesota where he was an instructor at the Minneapolis School of Fine Arts, now the Minneapolis College of Art & Design next door.",
