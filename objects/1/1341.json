  "text": "This painting illustrates the story of Christ's betrayal in the Garden of Gethsemane. Van Dyck apparently relied on the version in the book of John, chapter 18 in the New Testament of the Bible. <I>Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place; for Jesus often met there with his disciples. So Judas, procuring a band of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, went there with lanterns and torches and weapons. Then Jesus, knowing all that was to befall him, came forward and said to them, \"Whom do you seek'\" They answered him, \"Jesus of Nazareth.\" Jesus said to them, \"I am he.\" Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them.... Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's slave and cut off his right ear. The slave's name was Malchus. Jesus said to Peter, \"Put your sword into its sheath; shall I not drink the cup which the Father has given me'\"</I>",
