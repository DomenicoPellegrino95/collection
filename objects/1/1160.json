  "description": "This vessel has the beautiful proportions and soft profile typical of the group of Hu once inlaid with turquoise, other semi-precious stones, or perhaps niello. The animals which inspired the decor have been so corrupted and dissolved that the whole surface is a maze of lines, hooks, and spirals. Remnants of interlaced dragons are still discernible in the narrower bands, and occasionally, in the highly geometricized decor, a definite shape, such as the dragons flanking the central medallion, may be isolated. These medallion-like figures appear in the median line, with the decor pattern symmetrically arranged on each side. The middle one of the figures- best seen in the neck belt- is a t\\'ao-t\\'ieh mask with forehead shield, horns, and nostrils as seen in many appliques. The T\\'ao-t\\'ieh on the handle ring displays an interesting revival of a Yin-time motif a figure between the eyes showing one round knob in the center surrounded by six other knobs. Patina silvery green.",
