  "text": "The monogram \"JA\" appears on several surviving Chinese Export plates and serving dishes with similar blue and gold borders, including two tureens and a salad bowl donated to the Institute by Doris and Leo Hodroff.  They are believed to have come from the same large dinner service monogrammed for John Amory or John Amory, Jr., members of a prominent Boston merchant family.  European aristocrats and royalty began ordering customized dinner services from China in the 1700s, a tradition continued by Americans as soon as they gained direct trading access to China after the Revolutionary War.",
