  "text": "Daubigny was an important early supporter of the Impressionists, and his own work suggests the influence of the younger artists. This painting is notable for its gestural brushwork and touches of color, as in the vibrant, bright green hills in the distance. Daubigny's paintings were often criticized for being \"impressions\" rather than fully realized works.",
