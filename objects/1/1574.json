  "text": "Comic books were an important source of imagery for Roy Lichtenstein’s early Pop experiments. He was especially drawn to the genre’s distinctive pictorial conventions. He began Bratatat! by preparing a small freehand drawing of his source image, a single panel from a comic strip, enlarging his sketch with a projector and then redrawing the composition in a larger format. He intentionally mimicked the mechanical processes of commercial printing, using flat areas of tone, strong contrasts, precise outlines, and stylized shading. He also employed the technique of frottage, rubbing the paper on perforated metal sheets to simulate the Benday dots common to cheap photomechanical printing.\r\n\r\nFor Lichtenstein, the process of manipulating and altering the source image while retaining the quirky conventions of comics was critical to the work’s ultimate significance and meaning as fine art.",
