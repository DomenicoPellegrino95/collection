  "description": "The tang of this weapon displays the same unexplained dented contour as that on 50.46.21. The shape has been modified through the lengthening of the lower lug into an extended support along the shaft. A long slender leaf follows the curve of the blade. Above this decor, toward the base of the tang, is the eye and rolled-up nose of a dragon's head, its plastically lifted hord decorated with snakes.",
