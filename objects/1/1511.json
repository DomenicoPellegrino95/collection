  "text": "In the 16th and 17th century Mary Magdalene was regarded as a former prostitute, who redeemed her sins after becoming a disciple of Christ.  She spent her last thirty years repenting in a cave in Southern France.  There, according to Medieval legend, “every day … she was lifted up in the air by angels, and …. she was fed and filled with right sweet meats.” This is probably the moment depicted by the painter, Schedoni. What a rich meal it must have been, considering how plump and healthy the Magdalen appears!",
