  "text": "It was a popular image in the 1840s and 1850s: the young shepherdess, daydreaming in the forest while her sheep trudge through spring snow and nibble at emerging buds and grass. It isn't intended as bucolic reverie. Such scene highlighted the lonely lives of the herders, who were being left behind in an increasingly industrialized world. By setting his Seated Shepherdess' pondering look against a gloomy background, Millet evokes this sense of isolation.",
