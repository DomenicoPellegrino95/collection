  "text": "Ed Ruscha has always been fascinated with language and transforming text and cultural icons into high art.In 1967, he began making a series of \"paper ribbon\" drawings featuring isolated words as objects set in three-dimensional space. He drew these subjects in a trompe l'oeil manner using various drawing mediums, cotton swabs, and the palm of his hand to establish subtle tonal gradations and illusionistic effects. Ruscha maintained that he chose words for their appearance, sound, or spelling rather than for their meanings or referential associations. \r\n\r\nIn L'Amour, Ruscha presents a French word-object, whose meaning is well known to English-speaking viewers. Despite his statements to the contrary, the drawing's soft focus and lyrical expression reinforce the word's romantic associations.",
