[1] (Sam Salz, Inc., New York, New York); Putnam Dana McMillan [d. 1961], Minneapolis, Minnesota on December 19, 1957; bequest to MIA in 1961.\r\n\r\n[1] A need remains to determine whether transfer to Salz was direct/method of acquisition. The work was exhibited twice (1922 and 1936) at the Galerie Bernheim-Jeune in Paris. Did the work still belong to Vuillard, or did the work belong (privately or part of their stock) to Bernheim-Jeune'",
