  "text": "These gold phoenixes were originally parts of a crown or headdress most likely worn by a bride during the wedding ceremony. The phoenix was associated with the empress and the auspicious motif was standard in wedding attire throughout the later dynasties (12th-20th century). Meticulously constructed from plaited gold wire, filigree and plate gold, at least five such mythical birds in combination with gold flowers would have adorned the standard bridal headdress.",
