  "text": "In 1832, Eugène Delacroix traveled to North Africa with the French ambassador, the Count de Mornay, who was to negotiate a treaty of friendship with the sultan of Morocco. The event depicted was a ritual pilgrimage of the Aissawa, a Muslim sect of Sufi Islam, through the Tangier streets, during which the entranced celebrants performed self-abusive acts such as eating glass, or biting one’s arm (seen at bottom), in order to attract attention to their religion. \r\nThe commotion of the pilgrimage is conveyed in this vividly colored and vigorously brushed recollection by the artist five years after the event.\r\n\r\nThis painting once belonged to James J. Hill (1838-1916), the Minnesota railroad magnate whose collection of European paintings forms the basis of the Institute's nineteenth-century holdings.",
