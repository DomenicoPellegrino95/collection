  "text": "A ruffled head of curls. Dark eyes hidden behind thick glasses. The intimate features of Frank’s face, his every pore rendered in stunning detail, contrasts with his unrelentingly aloof gaze. \r\nClose modeled such portraits on large-format photographs, in which every detail can be seen. In fact, he literally copied photographic images onto the canvas using a painstaking grid technique, painting one square at a time, to preserve the objectivity of cameras, which reveals only what can be perceived by the eye. In some ways, the extreme detail and scale of these portraits underlines the emotional distance between viewer and subject. It suggests that identities are tentative, evolving constructions that are built rather than fully experienced, despite their pristine surfaces. ",
