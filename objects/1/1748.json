  "text": "This ingeniously complex inkstand may have been presented to Pope Pius VI to commemorate completion of the Quirinale Monument in Rome in 1786, just across from the Pope's summer palace.   As seen in the inkstand, the monument incorporates an Egyptian obelisk unearthed near the Mausoleum of Augustus and two ancient Roman sculptures of horse tamers. The horse tamers swing out with the press of a lever, revealing an inkwell and sander. The sphinxes’ headdresses conceal candle holders and the center drawer contains an assortment of <i>trompe l’oeil</i> engravings, including Coaci’s trade card. The two doves can be made to kiss by means of a lever located under the fountain.",
