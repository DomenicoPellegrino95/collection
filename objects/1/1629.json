  "text": "Ambrosia and nectar were believed to be “the food of the gods” in ancient Greece, and Ambrosia is often characterized as a fluid. The Neoclassical sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen shows Ganymede – the gods’ cupbearer – serving Ambrosia in a two-handled drinking vessel or kylix to Zeus, the Father of the Gods. Zeus is portrayed as an eagle, which is the guise Zeus took on when he carried Ganymede away from earth and to Mount Olympos, where he made the beautiful young man an immortal servant to the gods. ",
