  "text": "Late Chou potters borrowed freely from ritual bronze vessel shapes. This is understandable because through most of the Shang (1523-1028 b.c.) and Chou (1027-256 b.c.) dynasties, ceremonial bronzes constituted the highest art form. The <I>t'ao-tieh<I> mask handles, molded animal designs and shape of this earthenware <I>hu<I> relate closely to a bronze <I>hu<I> in the Pillsbury collection.",
