  "text": "This painting bears an apocryphal signature of Yen Wen-kuei, a highly regarded academic landscape painter of the Five Dynasties period (907-960). While few authentic works by Yen survive, his reputation was largely based on the towering ink landscapes that had come into prominence during his time.\r\n<P>The present painting is an excellent example of the popularity during late Ming and early Ch'ing for large, carefully rendered color landscapes that evoked the monumental mountainous landscapes of the earlier Five Dynasties and Northern Sung period (ca. 10th-13th centuries). The wealthy Ming and Ch'ing merchant class created a demand for large-scale, carefully delineated, decorative scrolls such as this for use in their luxurious estates. Paintings such as these, carefully rendered by skilled, professional artists for an affluent audience were substantially different from the smaller ink landscapes produced by the scholar-amateurs for the literati class with their emphasis on personal brushwork and literary content.",
