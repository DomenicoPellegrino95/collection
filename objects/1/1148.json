  "description": "Wine Cup \\'CHI\\', inscribed. The decor on a ground of spirals is one of restrained exuberance, dragonized t\\'ao-t\\'ieh (winged type) appear in the foot and neck belts, which are interrupted by shallow, flat flanges only on the long sides. The bodied t\\'ao-t\\'ieh on the belly displays tiny hooks on the forehead shield, and scores on the horns similar to those usually found on flanges. Two strongly stylized, head-turning dragons appear behind the feet of the t\\'ao-t\\'ieh. Rising blades, with spirals suggesting dissolved cicadas, adorn the neck of the vessel. The lid has two t\\'ao-t\\'ieh masks on a ground of squared spirals. Patina grey-green and blue-green. The meaning ofthe inscription, showing two arrows on a stand, is unknown.",
