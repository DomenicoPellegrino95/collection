  "text": "Giovanni Giardini, the leading silversmith of his day, was probably commissioned by a cardinal or a member of Rome's aristocracy to make this stoup (holy water receptacle) for a sumptuous chapel.\r\n\r\n<P>Giardini skillfully combined elements of Baroque painting and sculpture in his design. The oval relief of the Madonna and Child, Joseph, and a young John the Baptist is adopted from 17th-century paintings. Contrasting with this meditative scene are golden bursts of light and angels seemingly suspended in midair'dynamic features seen also in the work of the famous Baroque sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini.\r\n\r\n<P>Only a few examples of Giardini's work remain, because much Roman silver was confiscated and melted down by the French under Napoleon. Giardini's silver is known primarily through a publication of 1714 illustrating one hundred of his designs for secular and ecclesiastical objects.",
