  "description": "It is probable that this bird served as an accessory member of some object, possibly a piece of furniture or a large vessel, in as much as the ring in the beak is evidently a handle. Whatever its purpose, the bird is a magical creature, having crest, ears and horns. The broad sweep of its wings, adorned with scales, make it a beautiful one as well. The shoulder line is emphasized by a big comma figure in high, rounded relief. patina green.",
