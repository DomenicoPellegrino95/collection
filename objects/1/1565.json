  "text": "Frederick MacMonnies began sculpting while an assistant to Augustus Saint-Gaudens and a student at the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League in New York City.  In 1884, MacMonnies went to Paris to study at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, and he largely remained there until World War I.  \r\n<P>His French training influenced his depiction of nude figures, like Diana, with naturalistic poise, sometimes considered too erotic to an American audience.  The Women's Christian Temperance Union successfully petitioned to have MacMonnies sculpture of <I>Bacchante and Infant Faun</I> removed from the Boston Library.  While he sculpted in bronze, MacMonnies eventually turned to painting towards the end of his career.",
