  "text": "These masks represent the Guro conception of  idealized feminine beauty.  The woman depicted has filed teeth, scarification marks, modestly downcast eyes and an elaborate hairdo.  Masks like these were used in Poro society dances to provide an example of how a proper Guro woman behaves. Today they are primarily used in village entertainment festivals.",
