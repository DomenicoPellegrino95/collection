  "text": "In 1754, King Louis XV of France sent Etienne-Fran√ßois, Comte de Stainville (later Duc de Choiseul), to Rome to secure a decision from Pope Benedict XIV, which would settle the question of jurisdiction between the French Roman Catholic Church, the heretical sect of Jansenists, and France's judicial tribunals. The result was an encyclical, or papal decree, issued on October 16, 1756 and addressed to the French bishops. \r\n\r\nThis scene combines both real and imaginary characters to dramatize an actual historical event.  The enthroned pope is flanked by graceful female personifications of Religion and Divine Wisdom. Two cherubs on the left hold symbols of the papacy. Before a view of St. Peter's cathedral, St. Peter and St. Paul appear on a cloud below the Holy Ghost, who has inspired the pope. The portrait of Benedict XIV is intended as an accurate likeness of Batoni's great patron.",
