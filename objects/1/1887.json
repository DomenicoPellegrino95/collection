  "text": "Dating from the beginnings of Matisse’s search for an original style, this was the first important sculpture that he completed and had cast. It inaugurates Matisse’s sculptural treatment of the nude female figure, as well as his investigation of the expressive and decorative configuring of body and limbs in space. The bulging at the hip accentuates the sinuous pose, and the arms blend into the torso to leave the basic contours of the figure uninterrupted.",
