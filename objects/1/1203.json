  "text": "The art patron Shah Rukh was partial to historical subjects and natural color, but his son Baysanghur preferred a small painting format accompanied by stylish calligraphy and clear, bright primary colors made from the finest ground metallic-oxide pigments. These small-scale figures, exquisite colors, and exacting draftsmanship typify Timurid-period paintings, and this work represents the Baysanghur style at its best. The <I>Chahar Magaleh<I>, or <I>Four Discourses<I>, is also known as <I>The Mirror for Princes<I>. In a series of anecdotes this twelfth-century text describes the four advisors an Islamic prince required'a scribe, a poet, an astrologer, and a physician.",
