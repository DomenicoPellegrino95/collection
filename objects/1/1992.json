This table is one of only a few known American examples in the rococo style. The wood types and construction techniques used to make and decorate it are consistent with furniture craftsmanship in colonial Philadelphia.  As Philadelphia was the style center of America during the late-eighteenth century and cabinetmakers there would have had access to the most fashionable designs for specialized furniture forms.",
