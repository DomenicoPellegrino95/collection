  "text": "A scholar pauses to contemplate a waterfall as it cascades down the mountain, attended to by a servant boy carrying his books.  This traditional theme in Chinese painting relates to the eremitic genre, in which nature and solitude are celebrated as aims of an elevated, scholarly life, but also has religious evocations.  The flowing water represents the essence of the otherworldly or immortal and embodies Daoist philosophy, which posits that the meaning of life can be sensed, but not fully understood or translated into language.",
