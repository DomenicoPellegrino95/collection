  "provenance": "Alexej Jawlensky [1867-1941], Munich and Wiesbaden, Germany from c. 1922 to 1941; by descent to his wife, Helene Jawlensky, Wiesbaden, Germany and Locarno, Switzerland, to about 1957.[1]  (Galerie Änne Abels, Cologne, Germany). Lea Steegman, Cologne, Germany. (Galerie Beyeler, Basel, Switzerland); Bruce B. Dayton, Minneapolis, Minnesota; gift to MIA in 1967.\r\n\r\n[1] Kandinsky's second and third handlists (started circa 1916) refer to this sketch as being with Jawlensky. Jawlensky and Kandinsky knew each other from 1908 onwards, when both had to leave Germany suddenly in August 1914. At that time, Alexej Jawlensky moved to Ascona, Switzerland, and in 1921 returned to Germany and settled in Wiesbaden.  In 1922, Jawlensky and Kandinsky renewed contact with each other. Kandinsky may have given the painting to Jawlensky in the 1920s, and the painting may have been left with Jawlensky's possessions in Munich during World War I. Jawlensky and Kandinsky met for the last time in 1932, and at the end of 1933, Kandinsky moved to Paris. \r\n\r\nIn 1933, the Nazis declared Jawlensky \"degenerate\" and he was forbidden to exhibit. He remained in Wiesbaden throughout the war until his death in March, 1941. His widow, Helene, stayed in Wiesbaden until 1957, when she moved to Locarno, Switzerland.",

  "text": "This landscape evokes Biblical stories of the Apocalypse, which foretold Christ's second coming. In the foreground, a woman in blue kneels before a tall figure with streaming golden hair, possibly Christ, while in the background two horsemen of the Apocalypse vault a fence.\r\n\r\nAs a pioneer of abstract painting, Vassily Kandinsky thought art could make inner truths visible. An \"improvisation,\" he said, was \"a largely unconscious, spontaneous expression of inner character,\" or \"non-material (i.e., spiritual) nature.\" Kandinsky wanted painting to function like music, using colors and forms like melodies and rhythms—abstractly—to summon emotion.\r\n\r\nFrame: Gift of Galerie Thomas, Munich, Germany.",
