  "text": "This monumental bronze of the mythical hero Theseus slaying the centaur Bianor during the battle of the Lapiths and Centaurs was purchased by the railroad baron James J. Hill for his house on Summit Avenue in St. Paul. The plaster model for this figural group was exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1850, although this version was probably cast in 1891, the year that Hill purchased the sculpture from the Paris bronze founder Barbedienne.\r\n",
