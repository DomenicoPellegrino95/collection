  "text": "Roviale belonged to the colony of Spanish artists active in Rome in the second half of the 16th century. He was a friend of the anatomist Juan de Valverde. In this small panel he shows his debt to Michelangelo's Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel, finished by 1541. In 1564, when the puritanism of the Counter-Reformation established severe rules for the representation of sacred images, Michelangelo's most provocative nudes were censored and covered with 'underwear' by Daniele da Volterra, one of his pupils. Roviale's painting reflects the new religious atmosphere, but without abandoning an evident attention to the structure of the human body.",
