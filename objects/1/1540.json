Langston is standing before an open window depicting a bucolic countryside, perhaps meant to represent his own land holdings in Sarsden.  \r\n\r\nThomas Gainsborough was one of the most talented and sought-after British portraitists of the 18th century. While he maintained that landscape painting was his first love, his numerous portraits of English nobility brought him great financial rewards.",
