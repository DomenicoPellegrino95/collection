McMillan Land Company on November 2, 1953; gift to MIA on July 14, 1955.\r\n\r\n[1] According to Lynn Nicholas, \"The Rape of Europa,\" p. 92: \"After Ambrose Vollard's death in 1939, his brother Lucien, sold much of his share of the collection to [Martin] Fabiani, who had worked with Vollard for years. Among the group were 57 Rouaults. British export papers having been granted, [the paintings were shipped out of] Lisbon on September 25, 1940, on the SS. Excalibur.\" The works were seized in Bermuda, then sent to Canada where they remained until after the war. This painting could possibly have come from this sequestered lot. No date of acquisition by Salz has been found.\r\n",
