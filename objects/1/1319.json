  "text": "In Japan, Kannon are the most widely worshipped of all bodhisattvas, divine beings who deny their own passage into nirvana to help others achieve salvation. In its serene simplicity, this sculpture typifies an early style that flowered in Japan after Buddhism was introduced in the 6th century. The full, oval face and child-like proportions are related to Chinese and Korean prototypes. Such small gilt bronzes were easily transported, thus helping to spread Buddhism and Buddhist iconography throughout Asia.",
