As reported in the Gospel of Luke, the Purification of the Virgin and the Presentation of Christ took place in the Temple at the same time.  According to Jewish law, the firstborn of each living thing was to be sacrificed to the Lord, but children were to be redeemed by the payment of five shekels. Forty days after the birth of a male child, mothers were purified by an offering of two turtledoves or pigeons. The high priest Simeon holds the infant Jesus in his arms while Mary gives the birds to be sacrificed - an allusion to Christ's death.",
