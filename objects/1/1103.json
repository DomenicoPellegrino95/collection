  "text": "During the Sung dynasty (960-1280) imported white Chinese porcelain inspired a new chapter in Islamic pottery making. In an attempt to imitate the coveted Sung porcelain, Seljuk potters rediscovered a white paste first used in ancient Egypt. Composed of quartz, potash, and white clay, this medium allowed for thinner walls and a more refined carved decoration than did slip-covered earthenware. This bowl, whose shape closely resembles that of white Sung ware, is decorated with a delicate pierced design; a transparent glaze fills the holes.",
