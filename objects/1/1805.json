  "text": "Ivory gunpowder flasks carved with intertwining animals were popular luxury items in India between 1526 and 1858. Both ends terminate in antelope heads, one showing cheetah chasing a motley group of rabbits and antelopes. The body of the flask depicts cheetah pursuing fish, birds, dogs, deer, and rabbits, with small touches of paint highlighting the animals' eyes. Composite animals and scenes of predators pursuing prey were common painting subjects of the time.",
