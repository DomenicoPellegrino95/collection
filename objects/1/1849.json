  "text": "The New Testament parable of the prodigal son is depicted at the moment when the celebration of his return has begun. Instead of stressing the morals of the story - repentance and forgiveness - Pier Leone Ghezzi has created a festive genre scene in which rich colors, warm tonalities and theatrical lighting are combined with the airy, fresh colors of the landscape and musicians.\r\n\r\nAs the papal court paniter, Ghezzi specialized in religious themes, decorative fresco cycles, landscapes and theatrical displays. He painted this commission while a guest at the elegant Villa Falconieri in the Frascati countryside outside Rome. ",
