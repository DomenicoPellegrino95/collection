  "text": "These companion portraits have been identified as Moritz B端chner and his wife, Anna Lindacker B端chner.  As a successful merchant and city alderman, Moritz B端chner was representative of the newly affluent middle class that resulted from the growth of capitalism in 16th-century Germany.  Lucas Cranach, the court artist to Frederick III of Saxony, was commissioned by the B端chners to paint their likenesses for posterity. Here, Cranach captures the confidence, pride, and ambition that often accompany newly acquired wealth and improved social status.  Cranach's signature, a winged serpent, and the date of the painting appear on the extreme left of Moritz's portrait.",
