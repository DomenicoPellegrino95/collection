  "text": "This exquisite manuscript page bearing text from chapter 37 as well as the title and text from chapter 38 of the Koran typifies the artistic and technical virtuosity accorded illuminated books during the Mamluk period (1250-1517). Sultans and amirs commissioned mostly large Korans for the specific mosques and religious foundations they endowed. Multi-volume Korans were popular during the Mamluk period, when standard formats included large single volumes, double volumes, and smaller thirty-volume sets. The scribe, or calligrapher, enjoyed the greatest prestige among the several Muslim artists responsible for producing books. This page is written in a cursive style commonly called <I>muhaqqaq<I> script.",
