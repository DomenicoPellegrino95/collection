  "description": "German Expressionism. The picture encloses four figures in a tight, absurd configuration defined by a picture frame and a door frame. Two men dressed as harlequins raise a daringly balanced woman muffled up in winter attire. A waiter in tails with a tray full of champagne glasses slides between the figures. In the background is a broad sky, low-lying snow covered mountains, and two figures in a horse costume.",
