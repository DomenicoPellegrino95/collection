  "text": "According to Medieval legend, Mary Magdalen lived the last 30 years of her life in solitude in the Sainte Baume caves of southern France. Lingelbach depicts the Saint within the cave’s inhospitable stone walls where, as her biography records, “no comfort of running water, nor solace of trees, nor of herbs” could distract her from penance and prayer. In the distance, a port and ships symbolize the joys of the active life she has renounced.",
