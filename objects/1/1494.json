  "text": "Outdoors, winter is a time of dormancy; but indoors, by the warmth of the fire, life goes on. The occupants of this room pass their time drinking, playing cards, and making love. By the fireplace, two young women tempt an old man with wine and caresses, while at the table, two young men cheat an old woman at cards. Though one of the old woman's companions seems attentive and offers advice, he reveals her cards to her opponent by means of the convex mirror that he holds up behind her. Youth and old age, honesty and deceit, prompt action and inexorable time, are all revealed here. A sober ancestor portrait of a woman dressed in formal black introduces a moralizing tone. Gazing mutely down from her oval frame at this opulent scene of corruption and temptation, she is a telling contrast to the foolish old man and woman.",
