  "text": "Frame: Gift of Myron Kunin\r\n\r\n\r\nMonet made the footbridge in his garden at Giverny the subject of two series in 1895-1900 and 1919, and he returned to its wisteria-covered frame repeatedly in the 1920s. With its raw vigor and passionate coloring, this picture underscores an observation Monet once made of his water landscapes in general - it reveals \"the instability of a universe transforming itself every moment before our eyes.\"\r\n\r\nThis reproduction frame, with its ribbon-and-stave moulding detail, is in the style of those used by Paul Durand-Ruel, the famed dealer who worked with and promoted the Impressionists.",
