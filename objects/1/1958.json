  "text": "It looks like a blackboard, the matte dark grey background covered with swooping loops like a strange exercise in cursive writing. Inspired by the constant flow and process of writing, Twombly replicated the mechanical effort required to learn cursive. To do this with such a large graphic piece and without breaks in the line, he stood directly in front of the canvas and used his entire body to span the painting as he worked, stretching to make the line reach across. The result is intensely physical and rhythmic, allowing the jumbled lines to gesture toward emotion and discipline. ",
