  "text": "In ancient Rome, famous Greek and Hellenistic bronze sculptures were frequently replicated in marble, often in several copies. This Torso of a Dancing Faun and a similar, more complete marble version on the Uffizi in Florence, were both made in ancient Rome, copying a lost, Hellenistic bronze. The statue was actually part of a group. Its original counterpart - a Seated Nymph untying her shoe in order to dance to the music made by the Dancing Faun also ended up in the Uffizi, but the connection between the two figures was not made until the 20th century. The torso masterfully shows the ancient artist's understanding of the muscular anatomy in action.",
