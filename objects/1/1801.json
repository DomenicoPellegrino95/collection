  "text": "In its original complete form, this figure would have had a goat tail, still partially visible, pointed ears and small horns characteristic of mythological fauns. Ancient Romans associated fauns with the god Faunus who dwelt in woodlands and fields, and was believed to control the fertility of livestock. The faun is the Roman equivalent of the Greek satyr or god Pan. This remnant of a marble faun may be a Roman copy of an earlier Greek bronze sculpture, part of a group known as \"The Invitation to Dance.\" In this group the faun or satyr is tapping his foot and looking at a nymph who is putting on her sandals.",
