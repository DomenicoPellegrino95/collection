  "text": "The child-saint, Sambandar, lived in South India during the seventh century. He became very popular during the ensuing Chola and Vajayana periods and his hymns were included in the liturgy of many temples dedicated to Shiva. The saint is typically depicted as a nude child either standing gracefully, as shown here, or performing a dance. The holes in the base indicate that this image was carried in religious processions.",
