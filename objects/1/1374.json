He became very popular during the ensuing Chola and Vajayana periods and his hymns were included in the liturgy of many temples dedicated to Shiva. The saint is typically depicted as a nude child either standing gracefully, as shown here, or performing a dance. The holes in the base indicate that this image was carried in religious processions.",
