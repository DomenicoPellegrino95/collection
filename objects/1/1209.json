  "text": "The monarchy of Shah Abbas I, centered in Isfahan, reflected the shah's taste for sumptuous architecture, carpets, and elegant paintings. Portraits of courtiers, pages, or the lovers shown here, executed with beautiful flowing lines and sensitive brushwork, became increasingly popular at Isfahan. Although drawn from court life, this elegant depiction of two people embracing can also be seen as a Sufic metaphor for the soul's longing to unite with God.",
