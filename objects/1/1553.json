  "text": "The New England white steepled meeting-house, an upbeat iconic symbol of regional tradition, appears in this painting as a dying and desolate space. Hartley paints the structure on a single plane creating a sense of unsteadiness. The front and side walls are blended into each other, creating a flat and unstable base for the roof balancing shakily above. Thick outlines serve as the buildings only details, apart from the darkened windows, shown with lunettes drawn tightly against entry. The two rocks in front of the church seem almost like tombstones— a not so subtle reminder of the future of this iconic space. ",
