  "text": "Like many artists living in Paris in 1912, Piet Mondrian fell under the influence of Cubism. Back in Holland by 1914, he began his own experiments with abstraction, reducing natural forms to simplified geometric patterns. Unlike the Cubists, however, he eventually abandoned nature even as a starting point for his work, relying instead on a rational and intellectual style that he called Neo-Plasticism.",
