  "text": "During the years 1438-1455, Fra Angelico, a Dominican monk, painted one of his most important commissions, an altarpiece for his own monastery's church, San Marco in Florence.  The altarpiece was dismantled about 1840. The central panel and predella scenes are now in the church museum, but the six panels of standing saints representing other monastic orders, which originally decorated side pilasters, were dispersed. \r\n\r\nLong believed to be Saint Benedict, the subject has recently been identified as Saint Romuald (950-1027), who founded the Camaldoli order of monks, an austere branch of the Benedictines. He is represented with a book and reed staff formed into a cross, signifying his wisdom and strict adherence to the Christian life.",
