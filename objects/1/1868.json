  "text": "The Tale of Genji, by the 11th-century court lady Murasaki Shikiku, is a novel about the romantic prince Genji, his love affairs, and the opulent lifestyle of Heian period aristocrats. The story, with its emphasis on Japanese aesthetic sensibilities, remained popular through succeeding generations and inspired the creation of countless works of art. These screens illustrate two episodes from the novel's twenty-fourth chapter titled <I>Ko_cho<I> or \"Butterflies\",in which Genji organizes springtime festivities in the garden of Murasaki, his favorite consort. One screen shows the noblewomen with their multilayered robes enjoying the garden from exotic pleasure boats with phoenix and dragonhead prows. The other screen pictures the following day, when Murasaki dresses several of her page girls and boys as birds and butterflies and has them dance for the empress. \r\n",
