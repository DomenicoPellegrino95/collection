  "text": "These are two pages of five owned by the museum from the great Persian text the <I>Majmu'a-i Tavarikh<I>, or <I>Universal History<I>, written by Rashid al-Din in 1318. Shah Rukh (1404-47), amir of Timur, who ruled Iran for the first half of the fifteenth century, commissioned these leaves. The <I>Universal History<I> began with human creation and extended to recent events in Persian history. The exhibited scenes depict Moses overpowering Pharaoh with the aid of a dragon (left) and the dog Qara Braq, or Black Lightning, driving the wolves from the sheep (right). The Moses theme is drawn from the Bible, but the inclusion of the Qara Braq story in the <I>Universal History<I> remains unexplained. The inclusion of the dragon in the Moses leaf and the decorative drawing of the rocks and clouds in the Qara Braq page reflect a Chinese influence.",
