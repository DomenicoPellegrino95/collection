  "text": "Moses, who is clad in blue and a white turban on the right, overpowers the Egyptian Pharaoh with the aid of a dragon, representing a theme that is partially drawn from the Old Testament. The inclusion of the dragon reflects a Chinese influence, which in turn expressed the Mongol's patronage of Chinese imperial academies of history and painting.  Timur deeply valued his Mongol lineage, and used their victories as inspiration for his own conquests.",
