  "text": "The Buddhist religion has many symbols. This woman's necklace represents Buddhism's \"eight precious things,\" which include the wheel of the law, the conch shell, the umbrella, the canopy, the lotus, the jar, the double fish, and the endless knot. These eight auspicious symbols were extremely popular in China during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and were often part of the decoration of Ch'ing dynasty court costumes. They were also used in Tibet and Mongolia for Tantric Buddhist objects as well.\r\n\r\nThe wheel symbolizes Buddhist truth, while the conch, an attribute of royalty, typifies the voice of Buddha expounding the doctrine. Likewise, the lotus signifies spiritual purity and redemption, and the unending knot, longevity.",
