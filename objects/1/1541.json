  "text": "Among the most impressive examples of early bronze casting in Japan are large, bronze bells known as <I>do_taku<I>. Metallurgy, together with wet-rice cultivation, was probably first introduced to Japan by a new wave of immigrants from the Korean peninsula during the 3rd century a.d. Although <I>do_taku<I> resemble Chinese bells in overall shape, most lack musical resonance because of the thinness of their casting. Thus, <I>do_taku<I> seem to have been ritual objects and symbols of political authority. This bell was one of fourteen excavated in 1881 on Mt. O_iwa in Shiga Prefecture.",
