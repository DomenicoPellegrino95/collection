  "text": "This large mask, carved from a single piece of lightweight wood and colored black, white, and red, would have fit over a dancer’s head like a helmet. What kind of ceremony it was made for, however, is a mystery. The elaborate hairdo—three braids on either side of the face and a vertical, looped braid in back—is topped by a carved diadem, a headband-like crown of beaded raffia, characteristic of Luba chieftains.",
