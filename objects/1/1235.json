  "text": "This large mask, carved from a single piece of lightweight wood and colored black, white, and red, would have fit over a dancer’s head like a helmet. What kind of ceremony it was made for, however, is a mystery. The elaborate hairdo—three braids on either side of the face and a vertical, looped braid in back—is topped by a carved diadem, a headband-like crown of beaded raffia, characteristic of Luba chieftains.",
  "description": "Dance Mask; Carved in the round from a single piece of lightweight wood. Interior hollow. Features remarkable in that they resemble Greek and Sicilian works of the 6th Century B.C. The back of the mask, carved in terrace and striated patterns, contrasts with the smooth lateral contours of the face.",
