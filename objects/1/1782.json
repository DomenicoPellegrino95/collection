  "text": "This painting is a study for the much larger altarpiece by Francesco Solimena in the chapel of Santa Lucia in the church of San Pietro Martire in Naples. The Madonna and Child are represented on a raised platform, receiving the homage of three martyred saints. Giovanni (lower left) and Paolo (wearing armor), brothers serving in the Roman army, were martyred in 363 A.D. by the emperor known as Julian the Apostate.  Pietro Martire (1206-52), standing in shadow on the left, is identified by his Dominican robes and the wound in his head, inflicted when heretics in France assassinated him.",
