  "text": "These three masks come from two neighboring peoples of Burkina Faso, the Bwa and the Gurunsi. The masks were danced during public masquerades that accompanied ritual village cleansings, harvest celebrations, initiation ceremonies, and funerals.\r\n\r\nImagine a dancer wearing the 13-foot-tall serpent mask. By twisting his head rapidly from side to side, the long flexible body would appear to undulate, an effect reinforced by the irregular zigzag design on its towering structure.",
