  "description": "This small bell, of pointed oval cross section and a straight bottom line, has a relatively simple suspending device. It is formed of two confronted tigers facing backward and joined, head-to-head, by a plain narrow band through which a strap could be passed. The bodies of the tigers, and of the coiled snakes on the bosses, are filled with granulation. The remaining decor areas, on body and top, are filled with interlaced snakes, their bodies formed by four parallel relief threads. Warlike studs occur at the junction of the snakes' bodies.

  "text": "While the individual bells cast for graduated sets will typically display the same decoration regardless of size, it is generally true that no two matched sets ever bear exactly the same decor. This relatively small <I>po-cheng<I> has a simple suspension device: a plain loop carried on the heads of two head-turning tigers. The decor of the tigers and coiled snakes comprising the bosses is granulated. The remaining surfaces, including the top, consist of highly stylized interlaced snakes (a favorite Chu culture motif), the bodies of which are formed by four parallel relief threads. This interlace motif is even used to fill in the central vertical register, which is typically left blank as evidenced by the other bells in this exhibit.",
