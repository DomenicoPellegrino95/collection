  "text": "Notice the holes in the nostrils of the leopard and imagine its tail as a handle: this is an aquamanile (from the Latin for “water” and “hand”), a special vessel used by the Benin kings during hand-washing ceremonies. The leopard was an important symbol of the Oba, or king, embodying ferocity, intelligence, agility, and speed. The balanced posture indicates strength, while the perked ears and bared fangs show awareness and aggression—traits the king was expected to have.",
