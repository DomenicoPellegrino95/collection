  "text": "The Kashan ceramic workshops in Iran specialized in manufacturing luster-painted architectural tiles well into the fourteenth century. These tiles bear inscriptions from different verses from the Qur'an, which are translated as follows:\r\n\r\n<I>His messenger who...</I> (top)\r\n<I>...Do not know.</I> (bottom)\r\n\r\nThey  were probably part of a mihrab, the sacred wall niche found in every mosque that orients the worshipper toward the holy city of Mecca during prayers. The opulence of the tiles illustrates the special attention given mihrabs in Muslim architecture; as the most important part of the mosque interior, these features had to stand out visually within a vast enclosure - hence, the bright colors and rich luster.",
