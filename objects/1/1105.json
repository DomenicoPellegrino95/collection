  "text": "The decorative technique represented by this bowl exemplifies a group of wares from the Ilkhanid period (1220-1336) typically associated with the Sultanabad area in Iran. The brown floral and bird motifs are painted in thick white slip (engobe) with black outlines and bluish-green touches under a transparent glaze. The white dots are a typical Sultanabad motif, and molded kufic script encircles the outside rim. The related examples shown here are characteristically decorated with bird and animals combined with a dense floral pattern.",
