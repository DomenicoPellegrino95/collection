  "text": "Corot took this subject of ancient gods courting in an idyllic landscape from Virgil's Eclogues, a Roman poem of the 1st century <H>B.C<H>. With its moralizing mythological theme, this picture is an excellent example of historical landscape painting, a category of painting first popularized by Nicholas Poussin. Silenus is Corot's most overt tribute to his great 17th-century predecessor.",
