  "description": "In as much as Huai style vessels of hybrid character cannot be positively assigned to the definite classes of the ritually stricter early epochs, no special name is given to this specimen. The decor, in five successive belts, is a pattern of interlaced dragons executed in narrow, flat double bands. The eyes and the points where the tails of the upper and lower dragons interlace are accented by high, wart-like buttons. Stout handles on the shoulder of the vessel are surmounted by a t/ao-t'ieh head archaic to the point of having recumbent C-shaped horns which are, however, adorned with big tufts. The neck and the lower band of the body are bare.",
