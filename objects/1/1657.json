  "text": "In Greek mythology, Orpheus is portrayed as a poet and musician from Thrace whose lyre playing could charm all who heard his seductive music. In this representation, Eurydice, the wood nymph who became Orpheus's wife, kneels transfixed by his song.\r\n\r\nLike many Symbolist artists, Denis explored the power of music as a theme in his art, hoping to make the visual arts as lyrical and suggestive as sound itself.",
