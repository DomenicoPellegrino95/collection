  "description": "Wine Can, so-called \\'YU\\', inscribed. The decor is limited to the neck and corresponding lid belts, and to the handle bow. The first is divided into four parts by the rings of the handle and two free animals\\' heads. The lid with a ring-shaped knob, is divided into two parts by toothlike projections corresponding to the handle-rings of the body. The two belts are filled with antithetical deer, reminiscent of the Northern Nomad animal style, in rounded relief on a bare ground. The handle carries three t\\'ao-t\\'ieh like figures in narrow thread relief between three lozenges in high, angular relief. The handle terminates in rams heads. Patina silvery-greeen wih patches of red. This vessel is one of two that belonged to the Imperial Colllection. The inscription is the same on both the known vessels. See Karlgren, number 15 (50.46.94a,b) for comment.",
