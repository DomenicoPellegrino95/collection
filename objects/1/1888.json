  "text": "In many ways, Large Seated Nude is Matisse's most audacious work in sculpture. Taking a casual pose from painting - that of the reclining nude with raised arms - he swung the figure out into space, divided it into two radically different parts, and complicated the problem of conveying a central axis that supports the entire body, given the impossibility of the pose. As a solution, he depended upon the erectness of the arms, neck, and head to provide a sense of balance, given the figure's invisible means of support.",
