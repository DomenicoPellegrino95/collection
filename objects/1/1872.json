  "text": "The Greek architect, inventor and craftsman Daedalus is seen attaching wings to the back of his son Icarus, and pointing upwards and away. According to the most influential version of the ancient myth, as it is recounted by Ovid, Daedalus fabricated wings of feathers and wax in order to escape by air from Crete, where he and his son were held captive by King Minos. Disregarding his father's advice, Icarus climbed up too high in the air, and due to the proximity of the sun, the wax melted and Icarus fell into the sea and drowned. Over more than two millennia, the myth of Daedalus and Icarus has remained popular as an exhortation to follow the advice of more experienced elders, and as an allegory of the benefits and risks of technological progress. The flight of Icarus may also be read as a metaphor of the process of bronze casting, where the figures are first modeled in wax, which is driven out of a mould during the pour, where it is most essential for the artist to hit the right temperature to release the liquid bronze into the mould.",
