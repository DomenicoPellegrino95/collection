The figures, although lacking the refinement found in those he painted, exhibit this master's distinctive style, which others in his workshop copied.\r\n<P>The front shows a quadriga, or four-horse chariot, at rest. Standing inside are Poseidon, holding a trident, and his wife, Amphitrite. An unidentified goddess, perhaps Athena, and Hermes, who holds a caduceus, or symbolic staff, stand beside the chariot. The scene may depict the gods and goddesses preparing to depart for an Olympian council or for the wedding of Peleus and Thetis.",
