  "text": "False doors were common in ancient Egyptian tombs and were always located in the west wall. They were an interface between the worlds of the living and the dead, and the focal point for visitors to say prayers and deposit food and gifts for the deceased, whose soul was supposed to pass through the door. The inscriptions commemorate the priest Iryenakhet (pronounced 'year-ee-en-AH-ket'), who is depicted seven times. The central niche is framed by two door jambs and a lintel in a composition ruled by symmetry. The normal direction of Egyptian writing was from right to left, with the hieroglyphs facing right, but here the hieroglyphs on the right jamb face left (as do the figures) toward the niche",
