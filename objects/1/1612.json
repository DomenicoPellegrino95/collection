  "text": "When Guido Reni died in 1642, he was the most famous artist in Italy. His sought-after paintings became even more valuable, including those left unfinished. This late work—loosely executed and restricted in palette to gray, flesh tones, and scarlet—was likely among the incomplete canvases in his studio. As it passed from one princely collection to another before coming to the museum, the woman, whose appearance is only vaguely described, has been variously identified. A cardinal thought it represented St. Lucy holding a bowl containing her eyes extracted during her martyrdom. To others her turban suggested that she may be a sibyl, an ancient Roman prophetess, shown consulting omens, or Circe, the sorceress who turned Odysseus's companions into pigs. A more recent identification is Porcia, the wife of Julius Caesar's assassin Brutus. After her husband's suicide, Porcia killed herself by swallowing burning coals. Unfortunately Guido's death prevents any definitive conclusion about this beautiful young woman's identity.\r\nRecent conservation of this picture was made possible by a generous contribution from an anonymous patron through the Adopt-a-Painting program.",
