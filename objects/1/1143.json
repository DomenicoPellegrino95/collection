  "text": "All the linear patterns on this small sacrificial food vessel have been filled in with a black carbonaceous substance, to give added import to the graphic decor. Though not widespread, this technique can be found in other late Shang and early Western Zhou bronzes.",
  "description": "The principle surface displays a rectangular field of interlocked T\\'s on a ground of squared spirals framed on three sides by rows of spikes. Scored flanges at the four corners of the vessel are supplemented in the upper belt by additional flanges which thus divide it into eight panels. Antithetical, long-tailed birds flank the short flanges forming the central ridge of a rudimentary t\\'ao-t\\'ieh mask. Hanging blades appear on the cylindrical legs, and disfigured dragons in flat relief on the outer surface of the upright handles. Patina green",
