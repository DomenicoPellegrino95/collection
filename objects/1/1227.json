It took the most unusual circumstances, in particular the death of my old friend Jean Groult, for this picture to leave his famous mansion on Avenue Malakoff.\"\r\nThe Groult auction was held in Paris on March 21, 1952.\r\n",

  "text": "This picture may appear to reproduce the casual clutter of an 18th-century tabletop. Not so. Chardin carefully selected objects to convey specific meanings. A palette with brushes, placed atop a paint box, symbolizes the art of painting. Building plans, spread beneath drafting and surveying tools, represent architecture. An ornate bronze pitcher alludes to goldsmithing, and the red portfolio symbolizes drawing. The plaster model of J. B. Pigalle's Mercury, an actual work by a friend of Chardin's, stands for sculpture.\r\n\r\nThe cross on a ribbon is the Order of Saint Michael, the highest honor an artist could then receive. Pigalle was the first sculptor to win it. So this painting sends multiple messages: it presents emblems of the arts and of artists' glory and honors a specific artist, Pigalle.\r\nA still life (or painting of objects), which is composed from scratch by its creator, can be used to convey complex meanings.",
