  "text": "These pages are both from the same <I>Universal History<I> album as the Moses and the Qara Braq scenes in this exhibit. The king holding audience is Mughith al Dunya Wa'd din Qasin Muhmud, the son of Mahmud, who is illustrated in the envoy scene on the left. Sultan Mahmud, one of the most important patrons of Persian art and literature, commissioned Ferdowsi to write the 50,000 verse <I>Shah Nama (Book of Kings)<I>. He is shown here on horseback entering the city of Gananj in 1017 to pay Ferdowsi the gold due him for his thirty-five year effort. Unfortunately, the great poet had just died and was thus denied the honor the Sultan intended to bestow on him.",
  "description": "A page from the Majmu\\'a-i Tavarikh. It depicts Mughith ad-Dunya Wa\\'d Din Qasin Mahmud, son of Mahmud, grandson of Malik Shah, great grandson of Alp Arslan of Seljuk dynasty, King of Iran (571-525 A.H. - 1117-1131 A.D.). The king is on his throne; a bird perched upon its back occupies right hand center of the picture. He gives audience to four men, one of whom kneels before him. At his left a man is seated near the king on a camp stool, while another, standing, peers in upon the scene from the edge of the picture. The scene is painted against a bluish white hillside, schemetically flecked with grass and outlined in violet against a golden sky. Warm tints of green, yellow and red, with greys and touches of gold unite with clear red and a bright blue to form the color scheme.",
