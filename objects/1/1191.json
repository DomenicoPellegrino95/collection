  "description": "A page from the Majmu'a-i Tavarikh. It depicts Mughith ad-Dunya Wa'd Din Qasin Mahmud, son of Mahmud, grandson of Malik Shah, great grandson of Alp Arslan of Seljuk dynasty, King of Iran (571-525 A.H. - 1117-1131 A.D.). The king is on his throne; a bird perched upon its back occupies right hand center of the picture. He gives audience to four men, one of whom kneels before him. At his left a man is seated near the king on a camp stool, while another, standing, peers in upon the scene from the edge of the picture. The scene is painted against a bluish white hillside, schemetically flecked with grass and outlined in violet against a golden sky. Warm tints of green, yellow and red, with greys and touches of gold unite with clear red and a bright blue to form the color scheme.\r\n43.31.1 and 51.37.16,.19,.24,.25 are all from the same manuscript, the \"Majma' al-tavarikh.\"",
