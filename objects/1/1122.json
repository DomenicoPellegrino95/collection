  "description": "The blade has bevels broad at the base of the socket and narrowing as they approach the point. A broad raised mid-rib runs from a mask on the socket to the point of the blade. A decor of diapers, painted in double black lines, covers the blade. At each point of intersection there is a short, transversal line thick in the middle and thinning out at the ends. The butt cap for this lance is in the form of a slightly tapering tube ending in three sharp points. The cylindrical grip is encircled by a raised ring flanked by two narrow bands in lower relief. Two small holes beneath the ring served for the rivet that transfixed the lance head to the haft. The tube has a hole with cracks radiating from it, toward the pointed end. Patinasoft pale green (lance head), sage green (butt cap).",
