  "text": "The kings (Oba) of Benin and the high-ranking chiefs who served them displayed ivory tusks on altars honoring their ancestors. This tusk was commissioned by Ekeneza in 1775, the year he became ezomo, or military commander, under King Akengbuda (reigned 1750â€“1804). The size of the tusk and complexity of the images, meant to be read from bottom to top, rival altar tusks created for an Oba. Motifs include deified kings and important commanders from the past; warriors, European soldiers, and courtly women; leopards, elephants, reptiles, and mudfish.\r\n\r\nNote the mudfish-legged figure on the second row, signifying a deified Oba (others occur higher up), and just above him the small, long-haired figure representing a Portuguese soldier.",
