  "text": "Throughout his career, Graham Sutherland used semi-abstracted, haunting shapes that, like visual metaphors, designated completely different objects. The artist believed that art's duty was not to replicate the appearance of objects but to explain their essence through a substitution of forms.\r\n\nDuring one of the most powerful periods of his career (1949 - 1953), Sutherland created several highly sculptural, monumental standing forms that employed organic shapes to evoke the essence of the human figure. In <I>Three Standing Forms in a Garden</I>, some of the abstracted components employed by the artist are: bamboo roots for the lower part of the figure at left; a conical pillar of stacked corn for the trunk of the middle figure and gourds and hanging maize for the form at far right.",
