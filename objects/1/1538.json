  "text": "Combining Surrealist elements with the Romantic landscape tradition, Sutherland was a leading painter of the British Neo-Romantic movement. Throughout his career he used semi-abstracted, haunting shapes to represent completely different objects – art was not to replicate an object but explain their essence through a substitution of forms. \r\n\r\nDuring one of the most powerful periods of his career (1949–53), Sutherland created several \"Standing Forms\" paintings, which depicted highly sculptural, monumental forms inspired by organic shapes; these standing forms were meant to evoke the human figure. In Three Standing Forms in a Garden, some of the abstracted components employed are: bamboo roots for the lower part of the figure at left; a conical pillar of stacked corn for the trunk of the middle figure and gourds and hanging maize for the form at far right. \r\nRecent conservation of this picture was made possible by a generous contribution from Paula Vesely through the Adopt-a-Painting program.",
