[2] Gift to MIA in 1957.\r\n\r\n[1] It is very likely that the work was owned by Paul Guillaume, which may have passed into the hands of his widow, Domenica, later the wife of the architect Jean Walter (according to the Musée de l'Orangerie). Additionally, Zborowski may have owned the work at one time as well.\r\n\r\n[2]  The work was purchased by Winston and Whitaker for the MIA directly from Rosenberg. Whitaker was Winston's sister-in-law.",
