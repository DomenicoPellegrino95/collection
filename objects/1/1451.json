  "text": "During large banquets and parties, cisterns were used to chill wine bottles in cool water. This cistern was made for John Leveson-Gower, the First Earl Gower, and remained in the family until acquired by the Institute in 1961.\r\n\r\nThe superbly proportioned vessel is given power and individuality by two eccentrically-shaped handles bearing animals' masks on the upper volutes. Bold, faun-like masks spring from the body to support the vigorous leaf rim. Moulded panels on a ground of Régence-style scales enclose grotesque marks, and scrolls and shells are chased on the base. The sum of the parts demonstrates Paul de Lamerie's ability to produce, even in the early years of his career, a massive piece of highest quality.",
