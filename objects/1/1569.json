  "text": "Animals in Enclosure was created during Klee's exile in Switzerland after he was stripped of his professorship at the DÃ¼sseldorf Academy by the Nazis in 1933. It employs a labyrinth of aggressive shapes such as bars, arches, forks and arcs to create an imaginary enclosure for several hieroglyphic beasts. The relationship to prehistoric cave paintings and rock sculptures gives this work a sense of mystery and reveals most directly the influence of archaic forms on Klee's art.",
