  "text": "Hindu images carved during the Angkor period (877-1175) tend to be more austere and less sensuous than the serene Buddhist images of the later Bayon period (1177-1230). The erect pose, impassive face and remote smile of this head is associated with the concept of God-King (Deva-Raja) in Cambodia. The idea of representing divine energy in the figure of a God-King orginated in India. The Cambodian theocracy carried the doctrine to the point that some crowned images of Vishnu or Shiva are virtually indistinguishable from portraits of deified kings.",
