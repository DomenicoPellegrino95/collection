  "text": "Benedetto was a member of an eminent family of artists.  In this portrait, the sitter is depicted in accordance with the ideal of feminine beauty in fifteenth-century Italy, of which her high forehead, large, heavy-lidded eyes, arched eyebrows, and a long supple neck were prized characteristics.  A pale complexion and bleached hair were also desirable.  The sitter's simple hairstyle, fine jewelry and modest demeanor indicate that she is a respectable married woman of an aristocratic family.  The painter's skill at realistic representation is evident in her transparent veil. ",
