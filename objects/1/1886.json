  "text": "Frame: Gift of the Friends of the Institute and the John R. Van Derlip Fund  \r\n\r\n\r\nThis painting illustrates a New Testament passage. A young maidservant accused the apostle Peter, in the yellow cloak, of knowing Jesus Christ. Fearing for his own safety, Peter denied the acquaintance. While working in Italy, the Dutch artist Gerrit van Honthorst earned the nickname \"Gerard of the Night\" for his dramatically lit night scenes. Like the Italian artist Caravaggio, whom he admired, Honthorst constructed psychologically intense paintings through the use of strong contrasts of light and shadow, close-ups of large plebeian figures, and expressive hand gestures.\r\n\r\nRecent conservation of this picture was made possible by a generous contribution from Connie Nelson through the Adopt-a-Painting program.",
