  "text": "Asante weavers are highly regulated and are restricted to producing cloths in traditional designs, using specific stripe patterns, motifs, and layout. Despite the seeming rigidity of design, closer inspection often reveals a wealth of variation within the <I>susudua<I> (pattern blocks), primarily in the choice and placement of <I>adwen<I> (designs).\r\n\r\nThe body of this cloth contains an unusually large amount of variation in color and texture in the <I>babadua<I> (weft stripes). Nearly every <I>babadua<I> differs in the width of stripe, choice of colors and placement. There are more than three dozen distinct <I>adwen<I>  plus countless variations. The border, however, is quite traditional, with its alternating <I>nwatoa<I>, <I>babadua<I> surrounding two long rows of the <I>adwen<I> <I>'nkyemfre'<I>, which symbolizes the maxim 'unity in strength.'",
