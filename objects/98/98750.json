  "text": "This cup commemorates a centuries-old equestrian event that takes place in Richmond, Yorkshire, named The Richmond Gold Cup for its distinctive gold and silver trophies. Thomas Dundas, whose family hosted the race, commissioned in 1764 a new trophy design from architect/designer Robert Adam.  His refined urn shape was so radically different from the cups that preceded it, that the shape continues to be associated with Adam, father of English Neoclassical design.  \r\n\r\nOnly four versions directly inspired by Adam's designs were produced.  The Institute's example was the prize for the 1767 race.  Two cups remain in the families of their original century owners, and one is in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.",
