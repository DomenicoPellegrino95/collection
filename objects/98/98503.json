  "text": "Kente cloth is believed to have originated in Ghana in the mid-17th century. The first cloths were made of locally produced cotton and embellished with simple patterns of stripes and designs of indigo-dyed thread on a white ground. This piece, although more elaborate than the earliest cloths, is representative of the most traditional and enduring styles. \r\n\r\nBoth Ewe and Asante weavers produce this type of cloth in the old style. This piece is most likely to be Asante in origin, based on the geometric <I>adwen<I> (designs) and the use of the <I>Akyem<I> (shield) motif in the border and in the blocks of patterning. Two of the strips are noticeably shorter than the others; the weaver probably lost track of the pattern progression, as the shortage is equivalent to one full <I>susudua<I> (design block).",
