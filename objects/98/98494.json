  "text": "A Note Regarding the Mannequins:\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to present certain objects in a museum setting as they would appear in actual use. To be properly draped in Kente, the cloth must be wrapped, bunched, gathered, tucked or twisted to achieve the correct look and to secure the garment. While this treatment may be acceptable for the duration of a ceremony or a festival, it would severely stress the object to be left in such a position for many months in an exhibition. On the other hand, to view kente as a two-dimensional object does not adequately convey the splendor of the cloth, its flow and drape. Rather than trying to simulate an actual person clothed in a kente cloth, the larger-than-life mannequins in this gallery are meant to suggest the overall effect of wrapping and draping the cloth around a human figure.\r\n",
