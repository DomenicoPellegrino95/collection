  "text": "In the lower right corner, surrounded by vine-and-leaf motifs, is the phrase “Gray Days and Gold.” It’s the title of an 1891 travel guide to England and Scotland that Elmslie reportedly came across, but we’re not sure what it means here. It could refer to architect William Gray Purcell’s beloved grandparents William and Catherine Gray, the funds his father gave him to support his practice, or the typical colors of the firm’s designs.\r\n \r\nThis wood panel and its identical mate adorned a beam-end near the home’s front door. In 2005, they were removed for preservation and reproduced following Elmslie’s original design, but with a laser cutting the design instead of a saw. ",
