As the inscription, \"Raphaelle Peale Dec. 24 1821,\" and the depicted objects indicate, this was almost certainly painted as a Christmas present for someone close to the artist. The elements in the painting are all expensive delicacies: an apple, orange, hazelnuts, currants, Twelfth Night cakes, cinnamon bay leaves, and wine.",
