  "text": "Edouard Manet was an early admirer of Japanese art. He was drawn to the static nature of the compositions and flatness of the picture planes. He also responded to the popularity of cats as subjects in Japanese art. In this group of isolated felines, Manet captured the essential feline personality of each animal with minimal modeling and without an unnecessary line, much in the manner of Hokusai's Manga.  ",
