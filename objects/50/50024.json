  "text": "Moving along at a brisk pace, Death, with staff and cape, is prepared for rough terrain and inclement weather. Yet, he is also relaxed, content to pass the time smoking his pipe. Perhaps with tongue in cheek, Ernst Barlach contributed this lithograph to a portfolio celebrating the 60th birthday of Arno Holz, an art theorist known for his belief that art should as closely as possible imitate natural appearances.
