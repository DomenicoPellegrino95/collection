  "text": "This print is sometimes called <I>Marat's House</I>, because it was here that Charlotte Corday assasinated the revolutionary leader Jean-Paul Marat.  In the sky, meryon depicts Justice swooning and dropping her sword and scales in the presense of Truth, who holds a book.  A figure symbolizing Innocence wronged, at the top of the sheet, has just lost her wings.  While the people on the street seem oblivious to what is going on above them, the workers on the roof fo the building were amazed by this vision.  In 1863, Meryon wrote that he believed the early states of this print were some of his best works.  The impression on display is a very rate and early trial proof printed on a thin rice paper.",
