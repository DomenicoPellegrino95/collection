  "text": "Jacopo de' Barbari is the first Venetian artist known to have worked in northern Europe. This richly textured engraving was probably made while de' Barbari was living in the Netherlands. It reflects the international spirit of his career by marrying ideals of north and south in a single print. The fine, detailed burin work emulates that of northern engravers, while the natural and sensual bodies of the god and goddess-favorites in the artist's hometown-betray his Venetian roots. De' Barbari left Venice for Nuremberg in 1500 to work for Emperor Maximilian I. That year, Anton Kolb, a Nuremberg merchant, published the monumental View of Venice, an impression of which is currently on display at the entrance of \"Titian and the Golden Age of Venetian Painting.\" The design of the enormous woodcut, which took years to produce, is believed to be the work of de' Barbari.",
