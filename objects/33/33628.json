  "text": "This volume is from a luxuriously decorated set of the <I>Garland Sutra</I>, a Buddhist text. It contains a five-fold frontispiece featuring the Buddha seated on a throne surrounded by a red nimbus and decorated with exquisite gold scrolling. The surrounding figures include arhats, bodhisattvas, the Four Guardian Kings, and various minor deities and devotees. The colorful illustration follows the general pictorial style seen in Buddhist scroll and wall paintings. The colophon is written in 1457 by the Buddhist monk Xing Jueheng, who wishes his pious act will ensure his right to attend the three assemblies of the future Buddha, Maitreya. It proclaims:\r\n\r\n<P><I>May the empire always be secure,</I>\r\n<P><I>May the emperor flourish,</I>\r\n<P><I>May the Buddha light shine increasingly,</I>\r\n<P><I>And the wheel of the law turn eternally.</I>\r\n",
