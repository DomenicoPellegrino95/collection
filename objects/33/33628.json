  "text": "These two volumes are from a luxuriously decorated set of the Garland Sutra. Volume 55 contains a five-fold frontispiece featuring the Buddha seated on a throne surrounded by a red nimbus decorated with exquisite gold scrolling. The surrounding figures include arhats, bodhisattvas, the Four Guardian Kings, and various minor deities and devotees. The colophon proclaims:\r\n\r\n<P><I>May the empire always be secure,<I>\r\n<P><I>May the emperor flourish,<I>\r\n<P><I>May the Buddha light shine increasingly,<I>\r\n<P><I>And the wheel of the law turn eternally.<I>\r\n\r\n<P>The colophon was written by the Buddhist priest, Hsing Hung-chu, in 1457. He goes on to say that he used some of his own wealth in paying for the (painted) Buddhist images in these books and, hopefully, his pious act will ensure his right to attend the Three Assemblies of the Future Buddha, Maitreya. \r\n<P>The second volume contains painted images of the armor-clad guardian deity, Wei tuo-tian. The colorful illustrations here follow the general pictorial style seen in Buddhist scroll and wall paintings.",
