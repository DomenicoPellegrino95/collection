  "text": "By the 15th century, shorter, lighter blades called katana began to replace the long swords (tachi) previously worn by mounted warriors. Katana were about 30 inches long and were somewhat heavier, wider and less curved than the earlier tachi, but these characteristics made them easier to wield and better able to penetrate heavy armor without breaking or chipping. This blade was forged by Kanesada, the third master of the Hoshu-seki school in Mino province (present-day Gifu prefecture).",
