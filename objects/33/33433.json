  "text": "Simon Vouet served at the court of Louis XIII as \"first painter to the king.\" At the chateau of Fontainebleau, Vouet used this sketch as the basis for a fresco in the vestibule of the queen's apartments in 1644. The decorations were later destroyed, but they are known from a book of engravings that reproduce the works. This drawing even provided inspiration for the book's title page. The engraver, Michel Dorigny, Vouet's son-in-law, made significant changes to Vouet's drawing when adapting it for print, altering the composition and turning Vouet's robust, monumental figures into thinner, less classicizing women and putti.\r\n\r\nIMAGE caption:\r\nMichel Dorigny (after Simon Vouet), title page, Porticus reginae in Arcis Fontis-Bellaquae Vestibulo Picturae & Ornatus, etching and engraving, 1644\r\n",
