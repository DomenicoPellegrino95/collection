  "text": "Simon Vouet was one of the most important painters of his generation in France, serving as First Painter to the King and running a busy workshop in Paris. This drawing relates to frescoes he made for the vestibule of the Fontainebleau apartments of the queen, Anne of Austria. That project can be dated to 1644, the year following Louis XIII’s death, when Anne served as regent for her son Louis XIV, then just five years old. Although they were later destroyed, the vestibule frescoes are known from a book of engravings by Michel Dorigny, a member of Vouet’s studio and his future son-in-law. (Dorigny slightly altered Vouet’s design for the frontispiece of the prints.)\r\n\r\nThis study is executed in Vouet’s favored medium of black chalk with white highlights. The two monumental caryatids, raising a heavy oak-leaf garland above their heads, have superbly muscled arms and classicizing dress and hair. Between their plinths, two winged putti, adorably chubby, struggle to support a stone escutcheon bare except for the royal Bourbon crown (a closed crown with fleur-de-lis).",
