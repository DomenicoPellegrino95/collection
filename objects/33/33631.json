  "text": "This official school textbook, produced by royal decree, is a simplified and illustrated version of the <I>Shang-shu<I>, an early compilation of historical documents dating back to the Western Chou dynasty (1040-771 B.C.). The complete text, one of the <I>Thirteen Classics<I>, was considered a fundamental source for Confucian scholars and was often included in the national civil service examinations.\r\n<P>This complete set of 16 volumes contains 570 illustrations and 21 maps. It was produced during the brief, transitional period when China began to absorb western technology. The introduction of lithography in 1832 made it possible to reproduce the lightest and most minute brushstrokes which are difficult to achieve in woodblock printing. The new technology led to more elaborate compositions and impressions of greater clarity.",
