  "text": "George Morland, although dissolute and short-lived, nevertheless ranks among the most accomplished British genre painters of the 18th century. This picture dates to his most productive and original period of the 1790s when he frequently sought refuge on the Isle of Wight. The subject, while not unique in Morland's work, is rarely treated with such assurance and breadth of handling.",
