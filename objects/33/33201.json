  "text": "An early form of export ware, this stem bowl was reportedly excavated in North Vietnam and, as such, was probably part of the maritime trade promoted by the Mongols. Featuring sketchy floral sprays and tendril patterns, this type of Chinese blue and white ware has been found throughout Southeast Asia. Its presence in the region led to a broad imitation of the style in the fifteenth century by Vietnamese potters, further disseminating the Chinese blue and white tradition.",
