  "text": "Between the first and tenth centuries, northern Vietnam was under Chinese domination and underwent extensive cultural assimilation. Ceramics, in particular, were affected by Chinese culture. This model farmhouse takes its form from Han dynasty tomb models like those shown above. Similar to the Chinese models, it was made exclusively for burial to accompany the deceased in the afterlife. The two-story house is comprised of several separate pieces that stack together. It has a walled in courtyard, a ladder to the second floor living quarters, and an animal shelter on the ground floor.",
