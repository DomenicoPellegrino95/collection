  "text": "<I>Manhattan<I>, created around 1947 by an unknown artist, depicts a cityscape, complemented by a verdant park. Inspired by New York City and its Central Park, it reflects the idealism of the Midtown skyline, bustling with new architecture and business opportunities in the post-WWII period.  A color scheme of mauvish brown, chartreuse, and salmon depicts nature and city as one; the skyscrapers seem to be growing as quickly as the trees. The unrealistic color and composition of the buildings, as well as the animation of the trees, draws a strong relationship between textile design and printmaking as well as book illustration from this period. Each color was printed separately in a fairly complex process.",
