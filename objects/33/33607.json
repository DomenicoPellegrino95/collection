  "text": "In 1998, during Michael Graves's partnership with Target Corporation on the acclaimed scaffolding for the Washington Monument restoration, the architect, who dubbs himself a \"general practitioner,\" began having conversations with Target executives about affordable product design.  Walking through a Target store, Graves marked hundreds of household items he felt he could improve.  His first group to hit Target shelves in 1999 included this teakettle, a variation on his \"whistling bird\" kettle for Alessi from 1985. This less expensive version has a literal whistle on its spout; other variations for target include a spinning and a ferris wheel whistle.  Graves's blend of attention-grabbing details and Postmodern classical references on everyday objects has been a popular one for the store chain.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
