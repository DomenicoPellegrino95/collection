  "text": "Vietnamese ceramics made during the early period of Chinese occupation (111 b.c.-a.d. 2nd century) understandably borrowed certain technical and stylistic aspects of the Chinese tradition. Model buildings made for tombs were popular in Han, China (206 b.c - a.d. 220). Vietnamese potters made similar objects representing rural farmsteads, houses, and granaries for tomb burial. Such models consisted of simple rectangular structures often made from separate elements. These models provide a clear visualization of the type of buildings in use nearly 2000 years ago.",
