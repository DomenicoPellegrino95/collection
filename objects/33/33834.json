  "text": "Among the most elegant shapes associated with early porcelain production are the rare, shallow barb-rimmed bowls developed during the late T'ang and Five Dynasties period (9th-10th centuries) at Ting and Ting-type kilns in North China. During the Five Dynasties era (907-960), Ting kiln technology reached a high state of refinement resulting in light, thinly potted, porcelaneous ware of pure, white color. These four-pointed flower-shaped bowls were most likely inspired by T'ang (618-906) gold and silver vessels that were used by the aristocracy. The high artistic level and liveliness of Ting ware made it popular with the middle class, high officials, and imperial household alike.",
