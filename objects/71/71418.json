He replied in a letter dated December 30, 1880:\r\n<I>Please accept my thanks for the handsome specimen of Wedgwood ware you have been kind enough to send me, and for the compliment you pay me in having had my portrait placed upon it, with some lines of mine and titles of my poems. This is a very pleasant and very welcome New Year's Gift, and you have kept your secret so well that I have been taken quite by surprise.\"",
