  "text": "This extremely rare scene depicts two Han dynasty sword smiths creating new blades. They sit kneeling, facing each other in the act of hammering the iron blocks stacked next to each other into tempered swords. Several completed, long blades are piled to the right of each smith and ceramic bowls of charcoal briquettes used in heating the metal are also depicted. \r\n<P>The swords of the Wu and Yue kingdoms were famous during the Warring States (480-221 b.c.) dynasty.  The Qin (221-206 b.c) and Han dynasties continued to produce excellent swords. These fine weapons, along with the crossbow, were essential to the Han military.\r\n",
