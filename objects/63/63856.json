  "text": "The Jat people, many of whom are prosperous farrmers, live primarily in the Punjab and Rahasthan areas of India and in Pakistan. Traditionally, the men are known for their military prowess and the women for their embroidery, which they often use to great advantage on their clothing.\r\n\r\nThe pattern of white squares on this head covering's end borders is typically Jat. The woven bands added at the sides - to be worn at the crown of the head - are a preference of the Bishnoi, a Jat subgroup. The central area of the odhini incorporates a pattern called chaupar, based on the board design of a popular Indian dice game of theat name. An unusual feature of this garment is the use of embroidery to interpret the design as a tie-dyed cloth. Intricate tie-dyed head shawls, though popluar among other ethnic groups in Rahasthan, are generally not used by the Jat, who prefer embroidered decoration.\r\n\r\nThe museum has several dramatic tie-dyed odhinis in its collection . This embroidered piece shows how influential tie-dying has been throughout the region. It is a stunning example of the adaptive talents of a creative people.",
