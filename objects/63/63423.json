  "text": "Among all the shopping streets in proximity to Nihonbashi Bridge, the street named Suruga-chø was especially famous. Mitsui Echigoya, one of the most successful textile businesses and money brokers in Edo, was located there. In this print, multiple shop curtains are emblazoned with the white trademark of Echigoya. Suruga-chø also afforded a magnificent view of Mount Fuji. Standing at the east end of the street and looking to the west, one could see Edo castle in the near distance and Fuji in the far distance. Hiroshige faithfully depicted the famous view as well as female shoppers who have come to visit the Echigoya fabric stores. ",
