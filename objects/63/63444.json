  "text": "Located in the southern outskirts of the city, Kanasugi Bridge is neither a transportation hub nor a commercial center. In this print, however, the bridge is crowded with people wearing the matching sedge hats. The colorful flags and banners fluttering in the wind, many of which are emblazoned with the words \"køchñ,\" mean that the group is comprised of religious pilgrims. The square-shaped emblem on the banners identifies the group as members of the Nichiren sect of Buddhism. They are likely heading to the nearby Shødenji, one of the sect's most important temples. Such pilgrimages provided country folks with the opportunity to visit the city.   \r\n\r\n",
