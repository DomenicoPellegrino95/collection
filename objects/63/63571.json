  "text": "The name Biedermeier (1815-48) loosely refers to the bourgeois class of the Austrian Empire that enjoyed its prominence between the Napoleonic Wars and the Hungarian Revolution.  During this time, especially in Central Europe (Austria, Bohemia, Hungary, and northern Germany), classical forms were reduced to their cubic common denominators and then enlivened through the application of richly figured veneers set within dramatically contoured silhouettes.  This fall-front secretary desk is remarkable --if not unique-- for its oval form, rising like a column from a footed base and capped by a giant mushroom-like pediment, all of which are covered in carefully matched walnut veneers.\r\n<P>\r\nAs opened, a central mirrored alcove is revealed like a stage set.  It is enhanced by pen-work decoration, marblizing, and gilt-accented forms.  What is not revealed is a series of secret compartments for storing precious objects, suggesting that with this desk, there is far more than meets the eye.",
