  "text": "The later edition (right) of this print has a slightly different design from the earlier one (left) and even bears a different title. Four more figures were added to the later edition including two porters, a spear holder to the procession.  The subtitle was accordingly changed from \"Sunrise\" to \"Daimyo's Departure.\" Daimyo were feudal warlords. When they traveled, an official retinue of soldiers and servants accompanied them. The reason behind this considerable change in the later editions is yet to be fully explained",
