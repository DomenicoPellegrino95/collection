  "text": "This rather naively designed and executed quilt has more in common with folk art than with the tradition of fine quiltmaking. Nearly every aspect is unique in one way or another. Perhaps most unusual is the use of felt for the appliquéd pattern. Most appliqué work is cut from cotton, silk, or wool, the edges are turned under, and the piece is stitched to the background fabric. Because felt is manufactured in such a way that the edges do not unravel, individual pieces don't need to be hemmed, and the quilter can apply very small, intricate pattern elements quite easily. The design of brightly colored berries and birds against a black background -- reminiscent of a calico fabric -- links the quilt to the New England landscape in which it was created.<P>",
