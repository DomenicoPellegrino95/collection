  "text": "Teague's name graces the back of each piece of the Conversation line, though both Taylor, Smith and Taylor's and Teague's staff contributed to the fifteen decorative patterns of the line (\"Prairie Chicken\" was described as being \"adaptable to any informal occasion\").  Teague's contribution consisted of the distinctive square shape with rounded corners.  The popular Conversation wares were also produced in pastel colors borrowed from their Lu-Ray line, which was introduced in the 1930s.",
