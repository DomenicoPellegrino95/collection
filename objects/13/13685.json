  "text": "This dish represents a category of white Tz'u-chou ware wherein the main motifs, usually peonies or lotuses, are set off with parallel striations created with a comb-like instrument. The floral designs are incised with a sure hand in a much freer and looser style than encountered in earlier Tz'u-chou designs. Wall paintings in a Chin dynasty (1115-1234) tomb at Li-ts'un-kou, Ch'ang-chih in Shansi province support the stylistic evidence for Chin period dating.",
