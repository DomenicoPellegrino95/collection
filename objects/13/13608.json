  "text": "A headrest is like a pillow, elevating the head and neck during sleep, only in this case it also protects an elaborate hairstyle. Headrests have been used all over Africa, and the oldest ones were found among other furniture in graves in ancient Egypt and Nubia. They are still in vogue today among nomadic pastoralists in eastern Africa, whose lifestyle makes it necessary to use lightweight and portable household items.",
