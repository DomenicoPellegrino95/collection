  "text": "This well-preserved ewer and accompanying covered bowl were reportedly discovered together in the same tomb. They represent the popularity during early T'ang for high-fired white wares made in North China at sites like Kung-hsien in Honan province. Both vessels rely on rather simple shapes and clear even glazes for aesthetic effect. The straight-sided bowl has a cover with foot-rims that can be used as an attendant saucer. Its shape, with indented corners, is likely derived from vessels made in silver.",
