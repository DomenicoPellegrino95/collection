  "text": "This intricate stone screen (jali) allowed for air and light to circulate within architectural spaces. The spotted red sandstone from around Delhi had been a popular medium for architecture and sculpture for centuries, and the Mughals, the dynasty that ruled much of Inda from the early sixteenth through the mid-nineteenth centuries, used it frequently. This jali blends geometric and floral decoration, demonstrating the Mughal taste for naturalism. The two floral roundels in the upper corners are carved on one side with the word \"Allah\". Islam was the official religion of the Mughal rulers, and they also tolerated other religions such as Hinduism and Jainism, leading to widespread cultural exchanges.",
