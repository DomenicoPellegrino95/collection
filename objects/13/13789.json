  "description": "Cloth of light tan colored antique handmade linen embroidered with several colors.  Red and blue lines of various designs cross the cloth, which probably was for early ecclesiastical services.  Spotted deer in red are seen against the linen background, with small yellow birds on their backs, and under them.  Many primative ornati fill the piece, birds face small ornati, tiny animals processionally follow each other at the foot of the work.  Defective.",
