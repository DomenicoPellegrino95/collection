  "text": "Domenico Mondo's calligraphic pen work is on full display here. In this two-sided sketch, the artist invented figures to adorn an arch. He continued his studies on the back of the sheet, efficiently tracing the dark outlines of one of the figures from the front. He then worked up this new figural study in charcoal, this time showing the figure holding a book rather than crossing his arms. \r\n\r\nWhen viewed just right, the sheet's scrollwork watermark is visible. This identifies the paper as coming from Palermo, not far from Domenico's hometown of Naples. Also apparent are some small losses in the paper, where the corrosive iron gall ink has eaten through.\r\n",
