  "text": "Burmese Buddhist texts and other religious manuscripts were typically stored in heavily embellished and gilded chests called <I>sadaik<I>. The size of these chests varied considerably from the lidded type shown here intended to hold a single manuscript to larger cabinets with outward-opening paired doors. Decorative lacquer moulding called <I>thayo<I> is often prevalent on <I>sadaik<I> boxes and, when displayed within the monastery, they were often set on high ornamented stands. The basic ornamental style seen here is associated with the Mandalay region of central Burma. It persisted from the pre-colonial period (ca. 1825) into the early 20th century.",
