  "description": "A cloth of fine linen. An outer border of cut-work, reticello squares, punto reale, is united by bobbin lace to main body of cloth which is decorated with same design of cut-work and embroidery all around the cloth. Ends of the cloth are trimmed with a beautiful bobbin lace of same period as cloth as also the insertion and narrow laces on sides. This splendid specimen derives its fine effet ont alone from its perfect technique but also from the great beauty of its design which is a most interesting execution.",
