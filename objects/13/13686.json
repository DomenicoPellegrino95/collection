  "text": "Ceramic cosmetic boxes were popular during Sung (960-1279), and numerous examples have survived in Ch'ing-pai as well as a variety of celadon glazes. This one is decorated on its lid with an incised lotus blossom. The interior reveals three small containers in the form of open flowers linked by appliqué tendrils. There is a faint hint of iron brown accenting each of the containers. While the plasticity of Ching-te-chen porcelain allowed Ch'ing-pai potters to create rather complex forms, their ceramics were always utilitarian in purpose, as is the case with this container for powdered cosmetics.",
