  "text": "Extensive excavations of a bronze age site on the Khorat Plateau in east central Thailand took place in 1995-1996 at Ban Lum Khao. Archaeologists uncovered over 100 burials which, according to radiocarbon texts were datable between 1000-500 b.c. Elegant, trumpet-rimmed vessels fashioned from black clay and finished with a red slip dominated these ceramic finds. Most of the vessels were found placed beyond the head and feet of the deceased. They undoubtedly held grave offerings for the afterlife.\r\n\r\n",
