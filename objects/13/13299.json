  "text": "While the identity of the central <I>Jina<I> figure of this portable altarpiece is uncertain, it is surrounded by twenty-three smaller <I>Jinas<I> suggesting the artist has depicted all twenty-four <I>Jinas<I> or <I>tirthankaras<I> of the Jain pantheon. Excepting the two standing figures, all the Jinas are shown wearing dhoti seated crosslegged in the <I>dyanamudra<I> (pose of contemplation). Each has a silver <I>srivatsa<I> emblem on its upper body. The central Jina sits on a cushioned lion throne which also depicts small recumbent deer flanking a <I>dharmachakra<I>, a symbol which came to be associated with all Jinas.\r\nPortable shrines of this size were usually commissioned by the Jain laity and presented to their temples. This altarpiece bears a lengthy inscription on its back identifying the donors who commissioned it in 1579. ",
