  "text": "The central <I>Jina<I> figure of this portable altarpiece sits on a lion throne, and is surrounded by twenty-three smaller <I>Jinas<I> suggesting the artist has depicted all twenty-four <I>Jinas<I> or <I>tirthankaras<I> of the Jain pantheon. The Jinas, seated crosslegged in meditation, are shown wearing dhotis, simple garments that indicate their place in the Svetambara, or \"white-clad\", sect.  Each has a silver <I>srivatsa<I> emblem on its chest, also pointing to a Svetambara identity. Portable shrines of this size were usually commissioned by the Jain laity and presented to their temples. This altarpiece bears a lengthy inscription on its back identifying the donors who commissioned it in 1579.",
