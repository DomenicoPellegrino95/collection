The central, as yet unidentified figure, has inlaid silver eyes and sits cross-legged in a meditative posture on a lion throne, flanked by a pair of seated and standing Jinas. The other 19 Jinas wear simple garments and have inlaid silver auspicious marks on their chests  <I>srivatsa<I> . Portable plaques of this type were usually commissioned by the Jain laity and presented to their temples. This altarpiece bears a lengthy inscription on its back identifying the donors who commissioned it in 1579.",
