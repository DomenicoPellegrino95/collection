  "text": "Lace was one of the most expensive fashionable textiles in 17th and 18th century Europe. Because of the fine materials and the hours of skilled labor required to make it by hand, lace rivalled jewelry in terms of cost and importance. Different areas of lace specialization emerged throughout Europe over time, and the movement of this precious commodity across national borders was tightly monitored and heavily taxed. Its regulation just fuelled the desire of consumers – who often preferred “prohibited” laces – and the greed of smugglers. ",
