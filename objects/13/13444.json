  "text": "Representing the mind of the Buddha, the stupa (Tibetan: chorten) is the oldest symbol in Buddhism. Used on the altar as either a votive or reliquary object, it is a highly auspicious and precious symbol.\r\n<P>From ancient times the stupa was a burial mound commemorating a great person, usually a king. In the early days of Buddhism, stupas were erected to mark the spot where a portion of the Buddha's ashes lay. With time, stupas of all sizes were erected throughout the Buddhist world. Portable commemorative and votive stupas such as this were made in wood, stone, and metal for ceremonial use at the altar.\r\n<P>This style of bell-shaped stupa is known in Tibet as the Kadam Chorten. It is the Tibetan interpretation of the eastern Indian model that was brought to Tibet in the eleventh century by the great Indian master Atisha whose disciples founded the Kadam order. The tower of thirteen disks (<I>Chhattravali<I>) representing the thirteen stages of enlightenment is capped by a protective parasol surmounted by a crescent moon and sun, which symbolize the unity of opposites.",
