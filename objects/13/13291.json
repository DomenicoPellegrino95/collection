  "text": "Often cited as the first modern artist's book, Pierre Bonnard's Parallèlement was unconventional both in design and content when published in 1900. To accompany Paul Verlaine's sensual poetry, Bonnard produced a series of audacious, rosy-pink lithographs that amplify the author's erotic musings on Lesbian love. The model for many of these illustrations was Bonnard's longtime lover Marthe de Méligny, whose languorous poses are harmoniously interwoven with blocks of text with an unprecedented freedom and expressiveness.\r\n\r\nShortly after publication, the French Ministry was scandalized to learn that Parallèlement was not about geometry, as it had assumed, but rather erotic love. Some of the poems had in fact been banned in France. The government recalled the entire edition so new title pages could be substituted, to remove references to the French national press. The MIA owns both the revised and this rare original copy, one of a small number publisher Ambroise Vollard had sold before the recall.\r\n",
