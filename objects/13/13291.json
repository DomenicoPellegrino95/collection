  "text": "Shortly after publication, the French Ministry was scandalized to learn that Parallèlement was not about geometry, as it had assumed-but rather erotic love. (Some of the poems had in fact been banned in France.) The government recalled the entire edition so new title pages could be substituted, to remove references to the French national press. The MIA owns both the revised version and this rare original copy, one of a small number publisher Ambroise Vollard had sold before the recall.",
