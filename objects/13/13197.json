  "text": "The machine press, which was invented in America in the 1820s, revolutionized the glassmaking industry.  The process involved pouring hot, pliable glass into a patterned mold that was pressed by the weight of a man-powered plunger.  Patterns were originally cast onto the metal molds through the use of models made from wood.  This model here is probably one of several used to design the metal mold that made this glass plate.",
