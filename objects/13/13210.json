  "text": "There is a very old and rich tradition in China of furniture made from roots. At its most elaborate, frames for furniture such as chairs and tables were actually grown over many years into the desired shape. The tradition has strong ties to Taoist principles and a reverence for nature. As with scholar's rocks, rootwood furniture was particularly popular amongst the literati for use in their libraries and garden studios. This unusual stool is made from a solid section of cypress tree trunk. It is possible that the piece was found as we now see it, but the unusual drum shape with its central bulge together with the overall sense of balance might imply that the original section of trunk was slightly enhanced by the craftsman.",
