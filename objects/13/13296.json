  "text": "The pierced metal design of figures among buildings on the lid of this document box suggest that is was commissioned as a wedding gift. The gift-bearing visitors arriving at a mansion probably represent a betrothal ceremony.  \r\n<P>The rather unusual \"white brass\" lacquer (<I>pai-t'ung<I>), an alloy of copper zinc and nickel often referred to as <I>paktong<I>, is used for the pierced metal lid design, hinges, latch, and corner mounts. The silver alloy of the pictorial elements is finely engraved and inset flush with the black lacquer, creating a design of bold contrast. The interior of the box is treated with red lacquer decorated with a gold band of scrolling foliage d√©cor. ",
