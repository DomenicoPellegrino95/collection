  "text": "These three color plates are a selection from the 190 illustrations that Knorr provided for a marine encyclopedia written by one Professor Müller, a biologist from Erlangen. The success of this work, republished and translated into French, was probably due to the beautiful images of the aquatic fauna, carefully portrayed by Knorr from actual specimens that he could hold in his hands and examine. The artist’s love for their beauty led him to embellish their colors and idealize their forms. The caption “Ex Museo Schadeloockiano” refers to the collection of August Martin Schadeloock (1707-1774), a theologian and a philosopher, parson of the church of St. Lorenz in Nuremberg. Known for his impressive collection of books, he surely owned shells as well, as these prints declare.",
