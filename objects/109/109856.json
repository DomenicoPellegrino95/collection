  "text": "Beaded pictographs produced by Plains Indian women in the late 1800s and early 1900s were an extension of those that had been drawn by men for many generations. Menâ€™s pictographs usually recorded stories of battle, visionary experiences, hunting, and courting. Women mostly beaded geometric designs, but the rare object with pictographs usually depicted domestic scenes and courting. The very few beaded suitcases/satchels in existence were produced by Lakota from either Cheyenne River or Standing Rock Reservation. On one side of the suitcase, a suitor brings horses to his potential spouse as a gift, the other features two cowboys roping cattle.",
