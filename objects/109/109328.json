  "text": "Swoon is a street artist who creates life-size woodcut block prints of human figures, often pasting them directly onto abandoned structures throughout the city. Here she brings a fragment of the city into the gallery, breaking the boundary between traditional and street art, by constructing a sculptural canvas from reused materials and wood. \r\nThe two figures are Brooklyn-based poets and fellow street artists Alixa and Naima, collectively known as Climbing PoeTree. Using art and poetry, they seek to overcome the destructive elements of urban life with creativity. With this portrait, Swoon does much the same, honoring the two women as they hold each other—eyes closed and unaware of the viewer—in an intimate moment.",
