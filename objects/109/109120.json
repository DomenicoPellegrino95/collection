  "text": "Creating intricate artworks like this painting has helped Kusama manage her struggles with hallucinations and obsessive thoughts. She is known for experimenting with a wide range of mediums and production techniques, including painting, sculpture, performance, video, and even clothing. Her visual work is marked by attention to color and exuberant abstract shapes that employ a signature motif called “infinity-net,” a combination of interlocking shapes, dots, and other abstract forms.
