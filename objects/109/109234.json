  "text": "A “flâneur” is a French term for a man engaged in a distinctly French pastime: walking the city with no purpose but to observe and engage in urban life. Amer extends the term to women in exploring freedom and individuality, particularly today’s representations of female sexuality. She fuses the gendered practices of sewing (feminine) and painting (masculine), sewing images of Disney princess Snow White, surrounded by forest animals, directly onto the raw canvas. \r\nBut Snow White’s bucolic setting is interrupted by provocative images of women from a pornographic magazine. Such decontextualizing, the removal of both benign and erotic images of women from their original sources, highlights the simultaneous censorship and eroticization of female expression in the media.",
