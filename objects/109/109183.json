  "text": "This unusual stone sculpture features a lion atop a square base with foliate corners. The base is carved in low relief on top with four bats surrounding a stylized Chinese character <I>shou<I> or longevity. In ancient China, craftsmen often used word-puns and loaded homonyms in creating their works of art. The rebus in this context is the combination of a spoken word and a visual image, whose name is pronounced in the same fashion as an auspicious term. The images in this sculpture, the lion <I>shi<I> and the bat <I>fu<I>, are homophones for power and good fortune. Altogether, the design of this sculpture implies an auspicious message: a wish for \"official advancement\", \"good fortune\" and \"longevity\".",
