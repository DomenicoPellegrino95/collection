  "text": "The resemblance is uncanny. Using make-up, costumes, painting, and sometimes digital manipulation, Morimura Yasumasa has explored the intersection of art and identity by transforming himself into Marilyn Monroe, the Mona Lisa, and in this case Frida Kahlo, the Mexican artist known for her lush, surreal self-portraits (see below). Morimura, who calls himself a cross between an actor and an artist, says of the work, “The various elements of Dona Frida and myself mix into a muddle and a chemical reaction occurs, creating this imaginary Frida of mine.\" \r\nIndeed, Kahlo's Mexican shawl has become a stylish Louis Vuitton wrap, and instead of fresh flowers Morimura wears a garish tiara of artificial blossoms atop his head like a geisha's hair comb.",
