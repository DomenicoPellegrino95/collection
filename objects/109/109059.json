  "description": "Vase in shape of a standing warrior, hands on breast and cloak about him.  The head is individualistic and vigorously modeled, with details of headgear and earrings clearly portrayed.  Note puma head on headgear, ear plugs, and method of wearing cloak.  Note also the tendency toward understatement in modeling of body proper.  As in most Mochica potteries the colors are limited to brown and cream.",
