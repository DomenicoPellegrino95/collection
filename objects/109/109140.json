  "text": "Saul's use of cartoons and pop-culture imagery places him among the forefathers of Pop Art, but his pessimistic political satire sets him apart from mainstream Pop styles. The New York Times describes Saul as “an artist’s artist” and “a serial offender in violation of good taste.” He was inspired by 1940s comic-strip drawings and the brushy, painterly style of Expressionist artists such as Willem de Kooning and Max Beckmann.
