  "text": "Linnell was one of the most successful and influential British landscape painters in the early 1800s. He was among the first artists to regularly paint outdoors along the River Thames in London and in its rustic suburbs, and he captured natural phenomena with sublime intensity. His poetic view of nature resonated throughout the 19th century in the works of his many British and American imitators, particularly the New England circle of Transcendentalists who defined the early American landscape by infusing nature with lyrical spirituality.",
