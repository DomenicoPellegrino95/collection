  "text": "The complex carvings on this house screen (room partition) recall traditional Tlingit stories. The large central figure may represent the Raven. Large abstracted feathers hang from his arms and project out on both sides of his head, and his toes are pointed like talons. According to Tlingit tradition, long ago the Raven stole fresh water from Ganook, a petrel (seabird), who hoarded it for himself in his house. Raven took the water away in his beak, and escaped through the smoke hole in Ganook's roof. As he was escaping, Raven brushed his body against the side of the opening, and the soot turned his feathers black. As he flew away, drops of fresh water dripped from his beak and formed lakes and rivers. The thirteen small figures found on the perimeter of the screen are humanlike representations of the drops of water that fell from Raven's beak.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about the screen's history and meaning, including the story behind its commission by a well-known Minimalist artist scan the symbol below with a barcode scaner on your mobile device.",
