  "text": "The term shiviti literally means \"I have set,\" and comes from Psalm 16:8, \"I have set the Lord always before me.\"  Here the Psalm is written in the form of a seven-branched menorah representing the Menorah of the Temple in Jerusalem.  Devotional paintings such as these were meant to hang on the wall of a synagogue and were particularly popular in the Sephardic tradition.  According to a mystical tradition, the worshiper would be spiritually transported to the original Temple in Jerusalem while reading Psalm 16:8 in the form of a menorah. The inscription indicates this shiviti was painted to honor the memory of Jacob Kachori Shaul Mordechai Cohen, who died October 22, 1921.",
