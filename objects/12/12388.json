  "text": "Two <i>ōban</i> sheets were joined vertically to create a large image of a beauty. Such formats are called <i>kakemono-e</i> (hanging scroll pictures) as they could then be mounted with paper border and backing onto a simple hanging scroll and used as relatively inexpensive house decoration by townspeople. Because of this reason, these prints rarely survived.",
