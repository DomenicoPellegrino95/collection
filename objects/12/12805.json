  "text": "The <I>San-tz'u Ching<I>, written by Wang Ying-lin during the Sung dynasty (960-1280), was used as a textbook for children in ancient China. It is a long poem consisting of three-character sentences that are easy to memorize. The content of the poem includes the most important Chinese moral values like loyalty, benevolence, justice, and filial piety as well as a general knowledge of history, astronomy, agriculture, literature, and philosophy. A first lesson in proper behavior, the book is still chanted by children today.\r\n<P>Each of the 24 sections of this deluxe edition has a finely carved illustration matching the text on the facing page. Carved in the style of the Anhui school, this unique copy is unusually well-printed. This is an exception to the rule since, being used mostly by children, the <I>San-tz'u Ching<I> was typically not printed with quality illustrations or longevity in mind. \r\n",
