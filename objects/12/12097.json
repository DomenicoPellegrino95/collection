  "text": "Tiwanaku was a powerful pre-Inka state on the southern shore of Lake Titicaca, near the present-day border of Peru and Bolivia. Tablets were used to snort powder with hallucinogenic properties. Snuff was taken to combat illness, fatigue, and altitude sickness, and during religious ceremonies. This snuff tablet is topped by an image of an elite person, as evidenced by his patterned hat and tunic. Three-dimensional toppers like this are quite rare.",
