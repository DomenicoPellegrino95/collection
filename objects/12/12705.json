  "text": "The Longshan culture (3000-2000 b.c.) of north and northeast China is best known artistically for its thin, hard, black-burnished pottery. Formed on a fast turning potters wheel, this fine black ware is relatively rare. Ceremonial in purpose, the best of it is eggshell thin and highly burnished like the three libation cups shown here. Common Longshan pottery included coarser black, grey and red wares. The potters have taken advantage of the new wheel technology, well-refined clays, and high-fire kiln to create one of the most technically accomplished wares of the Neolithic era.",
