One of the distinct porcelain types to evolve was <I>Shu-fu<I> which takes its name from the low-relief moulded characters <I>shu<I> and <I>fu<I> meaning, \"privy council\" that often appear, as they do here, on the inside of the bowls and small dishes. <I>Shu-fu<I> ware is generally carefully potted with fine, hard bodies and thick, opaque white glazes with a slight blue-green tint.",
