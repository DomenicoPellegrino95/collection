  "text": "Recently Sikora has been experimenting with the use of unglazed porcelain ewers with accompanying stands. The form of the ewers derives from Korean and Middle Eastern metal and ceramic ewers used for wine and oil. The white surfaces of the ewer and stand are gently colored by the salt and ash added during the firing. The pierced stands, also decorated with applied and carved motifs relieve the pristine surfaces.",
