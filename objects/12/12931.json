  "text": "These rare miniature paintings served as a type of personal meditation card used in Buddhist rituals. Called <I>tsakali<I>, they were created for the Taklung monastic lineage and each of them has a lengthy inscription on the back that includes three elements; 1.) the syllables \"om,\" \"ah,\" and \"hum,\" 2.) a mantra written in Sanskrit, and 3.) prayers and comments in the Tibetan language.\u000bThe images depicted include a lama seated in the meditation posture on a gold ground; a lama seated cross-legged in the teaching gesture on a red ground; the Medicine Buddha, Suvarna Bhadra Vimala Ratna Prabhasa holding a black alms bowl; and the goddess Shri Devi seated on a red pony.\u000bTypical of the several inscriptions are:\u000b\u000b<P><I>The true sramana (monk-sage) abandons all attachment to the things of the world, and abandons all harm and injury to others.<I>\u000b\u000b<P><I>Incomparable Lama. May it be that you Prajna Guru and I Girtshair Rinio Woser Bhadra are never parted. I will act always in accord with your words and precepts.<I>",
