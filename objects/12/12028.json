  "text": "Under the long reign of the Tang Emperor Xuanzong (713-56), a fervent enthusiast of Daoism, most of the sacred mountains in the system of Daoist cosmology became imperial recognized sites. Every year the emperor dispatched envoys of ranking officials and eminent Daoists to the sacred mountains and rivers to perform a rite called <I>tou longjian<I> (\"tossing dragons and tallies\") in order to communicate with gods at these holy sites. The rite always consisted of throwing cast metal dragons into the sacred sites, accompanied by tablets inscribed with prayers for the dynastyâ€™s welfare and the immortality of the sovereign. The practice continued until the tenth century. This gilt bronze dragon was likely cast for such a purpose.",
