  "text": "Its sleigh feet, horizontal \"speed lines,\" and chrome plating gave the impression that cleaning would be a breeze, and its bold graphics proclaimed the name brand. Lurelle Guild's corporate clients included Westinghouse, Alcoa, and Electrolux, and helped to modernize the \"new\" material of aluminum through his product designs. But it was Guild's streamlined restyling of the Electrolux vacuum cleaner in 1937, however, for which he is best known. Unlike many manufacturers at this time, who practiced the annual model change, Electrolux manufactured this popular vacuum cleaner, with few tweaks, into the 1950s.",
