  "text": "This rare dish has an octagonal foliated rim and molded designs. The main motif is two flower-holding birds with outstretched wings. The background is decorated with floral sprays. The raised edges of the rim are left unglazed, indicating that the dish was fired upside down on the rim as is typical of Ting ware. The firing of Ting wares occurred in an oxidizing kiln environment, imparting a warm quality to the creamy-colored glaze. \r\n<P>A complex shape such as this with flattened foliated rim, raised edges, and ribbed well is based on silver designs. Silver vessels influenced both the shape and designs of several types of Northern Sung (960-1127) and Chin (1115-1234) white wares. The Ting kilns are situated in present day Ch'u-yang county in Hopei province. They began production in the early eighth century and remained productive until the fourteenth century.\r\n",
