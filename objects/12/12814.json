  "text": "Designed to resemble a common mail-order catalogue, Weber's editioned artist's book parodies his subject through mimicry and the fragmentation of familiar images into surreal, sometimes unsettling compositions. In appropriating pictures and text from actual sales catalogues, he created a series of collages that challenge contemporary standards of beauty and the social attitudes that value youth over wisdom, physical appearance over spiritual strength, and consumerism over community. Reproduced as a glossy color mail-order \"catalogue,\" Weber's book is at once revealing and troubling in its condemnation of superficial social norms.",
