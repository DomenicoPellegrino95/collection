  "text": "Stone, such as marble and granite, was a favorite material for the manufacture of outdoor furniture intended for gardens and verandas. Benches, tables, and game boards, as well as stools and chairs were commonly featured in large outdoor settings like gardens and parks, paved courtyards, and gazebos.\r\n<P>This stool is carved in the standard drum stool shape and, like some of the wooden and ceramic versions shown here, it has raised bosses encircling the upper and lower rims. More interesting, perhaps, is the stylized lion head, a common symbol of power carved on the side.",
