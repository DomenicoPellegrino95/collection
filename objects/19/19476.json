  "text": "George Romney embraced the “sublime,” the flip side of the Age of Enlightenment. He was obsessed with the passions, the power of nature, the supernatural—those forces beyond human comprehension and control. In the popular imagination of the 18th century, Lapland was home to witches capable of raising storms and causing shipwrecks, and Romney wanted to capture their magic. His efforts began with fiery sketches like this one.\r\n\r\nIn 1778, Romney’s friend and biographer William Hayley wrote a verse on the artist’s conjuring of a Lapland witch. Note his comment that the freedom of the artist’s drawing would need to be tempered when it came time to execute the painting. \r\n \r\nRound fancy’s circle when thy Pencil flies, \r\nWith what terrific pomp thy Spectres rise!\r\nWhat lust of mischief marks thy Witch’s form,\r\nWhile on the Lapland Rock she swells the storm!\r\nTho’ led by Fancy, thro’ her boundless reign,\r\nWell dost thou know to quit her wild domain,\r\nWhen History bids thee paint, severely chaste\r\nHer simpler scene, with uncorrupted taste.",
