  "text": "Imagine walking to your master bedroom, passing through this hallway, and being greeted by a stunning view of Lake Minnetonka. This was one of the delights of the home that Francis W. Little and his wife, Mary, commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright to design and build in 1908. The home was finished in 1914, and by the late 1960s it had passed to the Littles’ daughter and her husband. They couldn’t cope with its rising property taxes, inflexible built-in furnishings, inadequate insulation, and many uninvited visitors—and couldn’t find a buyer either. \r\n \r\nA group of Wright enthusiasts alerted the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, which bought the house in 1972 and allowed the owners to retain the property while portions of the interior were taken to the Met or sold to other museums. The MIA purchased this hallway, installed here without its fourth wall of closets and doors. This allows for a broad look at the windows, whose design Mr. Little insisted be subtle so they didn’t to obscure his lake view. ",
