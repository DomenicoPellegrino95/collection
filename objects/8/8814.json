  "text": "A noted California painter and printmaker, Christopher Brown uses personal memory and history as the primary sources for his works.  He explained: \"The ability of painting to combine memories of different times into one image, as we do in our mind, is one of the things I am involved in now--not simply what life looks like, but what our memory of life looks like.\"  In Brown's color etching of 1994, ripe plums fall as birds wait against an earth-toned background inset with bits of sky.  It is a memory of garden birds, sometimes seen from one perspective, sometimes another, sometimes remembered not as actual birds, but as if looking at pictures in a book.  It is in effect, a picture of a memory.",
