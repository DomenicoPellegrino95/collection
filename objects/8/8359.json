  "text": "This elegant, thin-walled jar is an early example of wheel-turned pottery in Korea. Before this technological advancement, vessels were built by rolling ropes of clay and coiling them on top of each other to create a container. Since such jars, with their flaring necks, round bottoms, and unusual handles in the shape of ox horns, have only been discovered among funerary remains, it is likely they once held ceremonial offerings.\r\n",
