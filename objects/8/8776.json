  "text": "Diogenes was a Greek philosopher of the 4th century B.C.E. He was a founding member of the Cynic sect of philosophers who believed that surrendering to outside influences was beneath human dignity. According to the Cynics, self-control and virtue were the most important characteristics of man. \r\n\r\nDiogenes is depicted with his lantern, in reference to the story that the philosopher carried the lamp around in the daylight hours as part of his search for an honest man in a society of scoundrels.",
