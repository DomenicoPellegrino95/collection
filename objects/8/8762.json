  "text": "As the son of Benjamin West, Raphael grew up around his father’s prosperous studio, later becoming his assistant. His tender young face could even be spotted as the model for Ishmael, St. John, and an angel in his father’s famous paintings. Such a refined life ill prepared Raphael for a trip to the virgin forests of New York in 1798 to survey some property for his friend William Beckford. Raphael portrayed it as a realm of forest monsters, a place where leaves are tentacles and tree branches are indistinguishable from snakes.  ",
