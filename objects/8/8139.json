  "text": "Hsiang-ch'i, \"elephant chess\" or Chinese chess was probably imported into China and the West from north India during the sixth century. It might originally have been used for divination, but evolved with time into an entertaining board game that provided both intellectual diversion and a social pastime. Games of war strategy, Chinese and Western chess are similar in concept, but in the Chinese version, the thirty-two markers all have the same shape. They are differentiated by inscribed characters colored black and red that divide the pieces into two sets. The chess board here folds up making it convenient to transport and use out-of-doors.",
