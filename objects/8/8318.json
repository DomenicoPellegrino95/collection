  "text": "In one of his many forms, the Hindu god Shiva wanders through the forest disguised as an ascetic.  Wearing only a loincloth and holding a walking stick, he has long, matted hair and is besmeared with ash.  By renouncing the world and begging for food, Shiva is the ultimate example of the fourth and final life stage described in the Hindu Vedas.  This small sculpture is from Cambodia, illustrating that Hindu belief systems traveled in the form of portable icons from India to Southeast Asia.     ",
