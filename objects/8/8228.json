  "text": "This print underwent several significant states, as revealed by the two impressions on display.  It was in his treatment of the sky that Meryon changed the image and in the tenth state shown here he inserted a crescent moon and vast flocks of black birds.  The swooping birds seem to menace the entire city and give this state an ominous mood.   The funeral procession on the bridge and the man foundering in the water seem to take on even more significance in the presence of the birds.  Some scholars have seen the appearance of the birds of prey in this state as revealing the mounting mental anguish of the artist.",
