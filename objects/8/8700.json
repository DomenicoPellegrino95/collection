  "text": "This print depicts the Kabuki actor Onoe Matsuke in the role of Øboshi Yuranosuke, the main character of Chñshingura. It is based on one of the three different productions presented in Edo in the year 1795. Wearing his costume in a slightly untidy manner and holding a fan in his right hand, Matsuke must be performing a scene from act 7, in which the leader of the forty-seven samurais carouses in pleasure quarters so as to divert attention from his revenge plan. Requiring an actor to alternately portray Yuranosuke as a reprobate and as a cunning warrior, this scene is especially challenging to perform",
