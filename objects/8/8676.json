  "text": "Triple-faced masks of this type are extremely rare. This example was made to be used in the Do masquerade. The three faces might relate to a ceremonial ability to see into the past, present and future. The male and female figures at the top probably represent an ancestral couple, but the meaning of the animal head below the chin remains unclear.",
