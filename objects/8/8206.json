  "text": "Kiyonaga designed more than one thousand prints during the 1780s and 90s, the great majority of which depict women. He often included several figures in his multi-panel designs and described their clothing in great detail. Hence, Kiyonaga's prints provide eloquent testimony about women's fashions at the time.  \r\nThis print is the right panel of a diptych showing five women enjoying an excursion to an iris pond. The figure on the left wears a sheer purple outer robe with an ikat pattern. Specialists have noted that sheer robes in black or purple with ikat patterns occur frequently in prints from the 1780s, suggesting that they were the popular fashion choice of the decade. \r\n",
