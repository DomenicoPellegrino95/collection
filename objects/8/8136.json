  "text": "It's roundup time at Rancho Pandemonium, and the demons will gather the herd. Heinrich Kley was extremely skeptical of the modern industrial world, and notoriously depicted demons operating a prominent steel mill. Whether the present drawing is intended as a direct attack on factory life remains uncertain. Kley's work as a satirical illustrator brought him international fame, and the animators of Walt Disney's Fantasia credited him as a primary inspiration. ",
