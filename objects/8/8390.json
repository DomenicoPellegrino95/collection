  "text": "September is represented here by a grape harvest and wine making. Bacchus, the Roman god of wine, red-nosed from drinking, oversees the crushing of grapes. His mother, Semele (labeled <H>semela<H>), and father, Jupiter (<H>iupiter<H>), appear in the upper corners. In the oval band framing the main scene, the twelve signs of the zodiac alternate with twelve pairs of women holding hourglasses, who represent the twenty-four hours of the day.\r\n\nMost large tapestries were designed as part of a series, such as the months or the seasons. Weaving workshops frequently made additional sets of such tapestry series for customers who could not afford to commission original designs.\r\n\nAcquired in 1938 38.40",
