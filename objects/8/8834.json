  "text": "This self-conscious masterwork combines several scenes from Matthew 19 into a complex assemblage. Christ stands like a beacon amid a growing crowd of supplicants and questioners. He is shown as Christ the multi-tasker: healing, debating, receiving children, and elevating the poor above the rich. The complex interplay of light and shadow invites a search for meaning; note the beseeching woman casting a shadow on Christ's face.\r\n\r\nPerhaps even more than his paintings, Rembrandt's prints brought him international fame. Writing in 1686, Filippo Baldinucci commented on the unusual nature of Rembrandt's approach: \"He covered parts of his plate with intense blacks and in other places he permitted the white paper to play.\"\r\n\r\nThe print is widely known as The Hundred Guilder Print, but for a long time no one really knew why. A few years ago, a letter written in 1654 was discovered, and in it the correspondent expressed his astonishment that an impression had sold for over 100 guilders.\r\n",
