  "text": "In 1962 Ruscha produced a book called <I>Twentysix Gasoline Stations<I>, a collection of deadpan documentary photographs he made of gas stations along Route 66 between Los Angeles and his hometown of Oklahoma City. Later he produced a painting and several screenprints based on the photographs. Like many of Ruscha's works,<I>Double Standard<I> has a punning title. The Standard sign urges you to buy your gas here, but it has other connotations--\"the model against which others should be measured,\" for example, and \"mediocre or commonplace.\" The title <I>Double Standard<I>--deriving from the crossed signs--suggests unfairness, especially in judging  male and female behavior.",
