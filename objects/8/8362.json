The subjects and decorative grounds link them to a pair in the collection of Queen Elizabeth thought to have been bought by Marie Antoinette in 1779. The similar oeil-de-perdix of both pairs may be attributed to Vincent Taillandier, who specialized in this type of patterned ground",

The objects illustrate a collaboration between painters, gilders, and bronze makers at the famous Sèvres porcelain factory.  A similar pair of vases, originally owned by Marie Antoinette at Versailles, are now in the English royal collection.",
