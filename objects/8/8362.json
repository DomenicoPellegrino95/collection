  "text": "This pair of neoclassical vases is beautifully decorated with gilt bronze mounts and painted Chinoiserie scenes, probably influenced by the work of Jean Pillement (1728-1808) or Francois Boucher (1703-70).  The objects illustrate a collaboration between painters, gilders, and bronze makers at the famous Sèvres porcelain factory.  A similar pair of vases, originally owned by Marie Antoinette at Versailles, are now in the English royal collection.",
  "description": "covered vase, cat. card does not list \\'a-b\\' for vase and lid; white ground, painted with turquoise and gold circle-and-dot pattern (oeil-de-perdrix); the wide decorative bands are adorned with exotic birds and chinoisirie. The subjects and decorative grounds link them to a pair in the collection of Queen Elizabeth thought to have been bought by Marie Antoinette in 1779. The similar oeil-de-perdix of both pairs may be attributed to Vincent Taillandier, who specialized in this type of patterned ground",
