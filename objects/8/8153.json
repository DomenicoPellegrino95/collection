  "text": "Matisse depicted figures making music in several notable drawings from 1922. In this example Matisse complements the theme of music – the most abstract art form – with harmonies and correspondences of pictorial design. The basic forms of the figures accord with each other and with that of the vase.\r\n \r\nMatisse exploited the conté crayon medium and the paper’s distinctive texture in an evocative manner. The lightly applied strokes with the side of his hard crayon stick – between, below, and upon the figures – suffuse the surroundings with a soft, sensuous atmosphere. This delicate shading, combined with the rhythmic lines of the furnishings and costumes, evokes a luxurious, music-filled room.",
