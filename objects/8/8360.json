  "text": "Korean potters produced celadons with underglaze iron-brown designs as early as the eleventh century. The majority of these pieces seem to have been created at local kilns which were not capable of producing the reduction (oxygen-free) atmosphere necessary to achieve celadon blue-green hues. Nevertheless, the elegant shapes and vigorous designs of Koryo iron painted wares are greatly admired.",
