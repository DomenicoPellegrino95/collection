Steiner   97.32.1.1,.2\r\n \r\nThese candlesticks were created by the earliest Irish pottery manufacture established in Dublin. The spiral design on the stem indicates it was hand thrown on a ceramics wheel. Irish craftsman were often known to reference Chinese porcelain patterns. Although, it is likely that this blue and yellow flower motif was inspired by perennial wildflowers that flourished in country sides of Ireland.",
