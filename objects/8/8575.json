  "text": "Both of these prints depict the famous actor Ichikawa Danjñrø V (1741-1806). Although shown portraying different theatrical roles, he is readily recognizable by his prominent nose and strong presence. In the print on the right, he plays Øboshi Yuranosuke, the leader of forty-seven samurai who were determined to avenge the death of their lord in the play Kanadehon chñshingura. Shunshø's print shows him with a clenched jaw, suggesting his unshakable determination to carry out the vendetta. \r\nShun'ei's depiction of Danjñrø V (left) shows him in an unusual costume with dark, bumpy skin, and claws for toes and fingers, suggesting a supernatural transformation. While the play is not clearly identified, Danjñrø's glowering expression indicates the ferociousness he brought to the role.  \r\n",
