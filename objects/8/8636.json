  "text": "This painting depicts the famous kabuki actor Ichikawa Danju_ro_ V in the play \"Shibaraku.\" According to the story, a corrupt warlord and his henchmen terrify innocent people within a shine precinct. The hero, played by Danju_ro_, enters the scene via the <I>hanamichi<I>, a raised runway leading to the stage. In a fierce voice he shouts \"Shibaraku!\" or \"Wait a moment!\" causing the thugs to turn on him. The ensuing fight, with its swashbuckling bravura, is a favorite among kabuki enthusiasts.  Danju_ro_, made superhuman by his righteous fury, annihilates ten criminals with a single stroke of his sword. His dramatic costume and coiffure, and unusually long sword, are all meant to convey his extraordinary strength and vehemence. In 1697, Ichikawa Danju_ro_ I first performed the play under a different title, but the scene became so popular that the entire play came to be known as Shibaraku. ",
