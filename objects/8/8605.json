  "text": "<I>Kyo_gen<I>, literally \"wild words,\" evolved as comic interludes devised as relief from the somber and philosophical themes of No_ performances. A down-to-earth, colloquial theatrical form, <I>Kyo_gen<I> characters highlight human foibles and frailties. This handscroll is one of a pair, each of which depicts scenes from eleven <I>Kyo_gen<I> plays. This section illustrates the climatic scene from the play \"Kubihiki,\" in which the legendary warrior and strongman Minamoto Tametomo (1139-1170) is challenged by a demon-princess and her henchmen to various tests of his strength. Here, they engage in a spirited bout of tug-a-war. ",
