  "text": "This charger is decorated in slip, or clay that is mixed with water to a liquid consistency.  To create the marbled decoration, the multi-colored slip was carefully applied in lines and then swirled, probaby with the use of a comb.  Staffordshire potters like John Simpson excelled at slipware decoration during the late 17th and early 18th centuries.",
