On retirement he traveled to New York with the intention of forming a collection of late 19th and early 20th century paintings under the guidance of Richard S. Davis, then chief curator. When he died in 1961 he bequeathed nearly twenty-four masterpieces which form the core of the museum's 20th century collection.",
