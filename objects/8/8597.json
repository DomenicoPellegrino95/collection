  "text": "This painting depicts the famous Kabuki actor Ichikawa Danju_ro_ V in the play \"Shibaraku.\" According to the story, a corrupt warlord and his henchmen terrify innocent people within a shine precinct. The hero, played by Danju_ro_, enters the scene via the <I>hanamichi<I>, a raised runway leading to the stage. In a fierce voice he shouts \"Shibaraku!\" or \"Wait a moment!\" causing the thugs to turn on him. The ensuing fight, with its swashbuckling bravura, is a favorite among Kabuki enthusiasts.  Danju_ro_, made superhuman by his righteous fury, annihilates ten criminals with a single stroke of his sword. His dramatic costume and coiffure, and unusually long sword, are all meant to convey his extraordinary strength and vehemence. This painting of Danju_ro_ V bears a poetic inscription by the actor himself, written when he was fifty-seven years old. The poem is written from the viewpoint of a fellow actor, referring to Danju_ro_ by his stage name of Ebizo_: \r\n\r\n<P><I>Ebizo_ has given up being an actor; <I>\r\n<P><I>Being a performer myself,<I>\r\n<P><I>I regret it happened<I> \r\n<P><I>to such a good actor as he.<I> \r\n",
