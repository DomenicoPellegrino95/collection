  "text": "Too much of a good thing' Maher reproduced the tiger lilies on this custom-made silver service throughout the house he designed for Ernest and Grace King, including on the nearby bronze urn and armchair. He took the “unified design” philosophy to extremes, believing that repeated motifs would harmonize a home and its occupants. In reality, the Kings were overwhelmed by the repetition. But they felt compelled to accept it, even at a high cost: Today’s equivalent of what they paid for the coffee and tea service alone could buy a very nice family car today.",
