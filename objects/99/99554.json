  "text": "During Japan’s Edo period (1600-1868), it was customary for young, unmarried women to wear <I>furisode</I>, a type of robe with long, hanging sleeves. Young women of the merchant and warrior classes preferred opulent, even somewhat flamboyant designs. The design and decoration of this robe suggest that it was once a <I>furisode</I> for a younger woman, but it's sleeves were probably shortened so that its owner could continue to wear it after she was married. It is lavishly decorated with an overall pattern of peonies, chrysanthemums, wisteria, and <I>chūkei</I> (a type of folding fan). The underlying figured silk damask has been dyed with <I>benihana</I> (safflower), to produce the robe's beautiful, reddish-orange color, appropriate for young women.",
