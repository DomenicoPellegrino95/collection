  "text": "Honoho Tankyu_ was born and raised in the town of Tachikui, in Hyogo Prefecture, long a production area for Tamba ware--utilitarian vessels admired for their handsome dark brown coloration. The son of a potter, Honoho apprenticed with his father after graduating from high school in 1948. For the next twenty-seven years he labored in obscurity until first solo exhibition in 1975. His follows the Tamba tradition of leaving his wares unglazed, but he achieves a contemporary look through his distinctly modern shapes. ",
