  "text": "While early ink painting in Japan often featured Zen themes, by the 15th century professional Japanese painters were producing decorative images with seasonal themes that were inspired by imported Ming dynasty academic paintings. Here, the artist relied on \"boneless\" brushwork (without outlines) to imbue the millet leaves with a believable lightness. The sketchy but naturalistic rendering of the birds brilliantly captures the spirit of their movement.  ",
