  "text": "Picture frames served as mementos to those who purchased them.  This one commemorates a visit to Detroit.  Artists often sold whimseys at larger exhibitions and fairs as well as vacation destinations like Niagara Falls.  The beaded leaves may allude to the role that elm trees have in creating important items of daily use. This piece also reflects a more streamlined, two dimensional style often associated with Mohawk artists.",
