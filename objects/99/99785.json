  "text": "William Hunt Diederich had a formal art education at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts but was also influenced by American folk art. His work often featured themes from the animal kingdom, mythology, and the sporting world. “Chanticleer” as a word for “rooster” comes from the name of the rooster character in medieval French fables.\r\n\r\nAs a professional artist, Diederich had a circle of friends that included avant-garde artists such as Alexander Calder, whose abstract mobile you can see in the lobby of Mia. \r\n",
