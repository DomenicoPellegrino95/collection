  "text": "Takegoshi Jun is the eldest son of the famous Kutani ware ceramist Takegoshi Taizan III (1919-84). He became an independent artist in 1972 after graduating from Kanazawa College of Art. Like his father, he continues to use the saturated palatte of colors associated with traditional Kutani ware, but he has developed his own aesthetic vision by isolating his masterfully rendered birds and flowers against a white background.
