  "text": "Highly educated Confucian scholars in China and Korea were often skilled calligraphers. On occasion, they also displayed their facility with the brush by rendering certain plants in a highly calligraphic style. Although grapes lack the symbolic associates of the Four Gentlemen (plum, orchid, chrysanthemum, and bamboo), they became a popular theme among literati artists in China during the Southern Song dynasty (1127-1279).  By the 16th century, they were also a standard theme among Korean scholar-painters, who used paintings of them to decorate their <I>sarangbang<I>, the study and living quarters for men of <I>yangban<I> households. In keeping with Confucian aesthetic sensibilities, these rooms were furnished simply, with white paper walls, wood furniture, porcelain vessels, and ink paintings.",
