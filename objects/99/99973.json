  "text": "Fragments of very old handscrolls, particularly those that reflected the poetic sentiments of aristocrats from Japan's classical past, became popular for display in tea ceremonies. This fragment represents the poetess Koo_gimi, wife of Prince Shigeakira, a descendant of Emperor Daigo (reigned 897-930). She is shown in the multi-layered robes of a noblewoman, with her long black tresses trailing elegantly behind her. Koo_gimi is sometimes included among a group of writers collectively known as the \"Thirty-six Immortal Poets,\" a concept first conceived by the courtier Fujiwara Kinto_ in the 11th century. Here her poem hints at the melancholy mood of a failed love affair: \r\n\r\n<P><I>Nightly visits across Iwabashi stopped.<I>\r\n<P><I>When morning came, sadness surrounded<I>\r\n<P><I>Katsuragi Mountain.<I>\r\n",
