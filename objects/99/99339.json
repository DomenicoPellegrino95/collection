  "text": "One of the company's greatest strengths is seeing the potential of industrial materials not traditionally associated with fine fabric production.  In this instance, the use of ultra fine stainless steel yarns that had been developed in 1997 by a Japanese tire manufacturer were woven into a simple fabric.  Then, inspired by how cooking pans discolor over an open flame, a gas burner was hand applied to the stainless steel cloth and the brilliant metallic lusters we see here were created.",
