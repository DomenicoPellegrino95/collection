  "text": "During the weaving process of a plain polyester fabric, thin strips of paper are added as a supplemental weft.  Although the structure of the weave is quite simple the finishing technique requires great skill and so Japan's famous metal foil brocade specialists were an important part of the final production stages of this textile.\r\n\r\nMinowashi paper, from the Mino region near Gifu in the mountains of central Honshu, is used in this fabric. It is known for its strength and has long been used for Japan's famous shoji paper sliding doors.",
