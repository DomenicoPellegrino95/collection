  "text": "The Japanese did not represent their indigenous Shinto gods in anthropomorphic form until the 8th century. Before that time, they worshipped natural phenomena such as unusually large rocks, ancient trees, or waterfalls as manifestations of Shinto deities. The importation and production of a large number of Buddhist sculptures and paintings prompted the Japanese to represent their Shinto gods as well. Niu Myo_jin was a female mountain deity associated with Mount Ko_ya. When the Japanese Buddhist priest Ku_kai (774-835) wanted to build a monastery on Mount Ko_ya, he ceremonially sought permission from Niu Myo_jin in 816. According to tradition, Niu Myo_jin and her son, Kariba, became guardians of the monastery. As is typical of such paintings of Shinto gods, Niu Myo_jin is represented as a court noblewoman.",
