  "text": "Although trained in ceramics at the Kyoto City University of Arts under Tomimoto Kenkichi (1886-1963), Matsuda Yuriko draws her inspiration from the highly decorative tradition of overglaze porcelains produced at the Arita kilns on the southern most island of Kyushu. Rather than using the traditional Arita palette and floral motifs to decorate conventional bowls and vases, Matsuda embellishes female body parts--legs, lips, feet, and buttocks--as well as organic forms such as bell peppers, pears, and apples.",
