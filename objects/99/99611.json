  "text": "In the early 1980s, Hayashi began to coat his sculptures with black slip. The subtle play of light and shadow across the dark, sculpted surface can create visual ambiguities. By the mid-80s, Hayashi began to accentuate these effects by inlaying precisely incised lines with white slip, and by masking certain portions while applying a gray or gloss glaze to other parts with an atomizer. Sometimes these embellishments contribute to the illusion of three-dimensionality, and sometimes they deny it.",
