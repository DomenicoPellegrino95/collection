  "text": "Lwena and Chokwe artists were inspired by European objects like chairs and teapots to make new forms of art. This spouted vessel is such an example. It has a lid shaped in the form of a human head, which has been incorporated into the main body of the pot. The fine black glossy glaze is typical for this kind of vessel, employed as a container for water or palm wine. ",
