  "text": "Raffia cloth is a very labor-intensive textile to produce, because of the lengthy process to prepare the fibers from raffia palm leaves. Dida garments are exceptional for their technique, which requires the interlacing of three sets of raffia threads. The threads are kept in tension by a loop of fiber held by the weaver's foot - no loom is used. This technique produces a tube-shaped cloth, which is adorned using a tie and dye technique.\r\n\r\nThe yellow and red colors are obtained from plant roots, and black is made from combining minerals and leaves. The crinkled texture is left unsmoothed, perhaps to complement the wearer's scarification. Among the Dida people, raffia cloth was associated with status, wealth, and power, whereas common people used to dress in beaten barkcloth.",
