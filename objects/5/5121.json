The paste, made of red pigments and oils, was used to stamp paintings, calligraphy, rubbings, and books with collectors' names and seals. The bottom of this fine container bears an imperial Ch'ien-lung (1736-95) mark, whereas the lid has a sixteen-character poem written in clerical script. The poem reads:\r\n\r\n<P><I>The gathering of a person's constitution\r\nBrings together all that is pure and virtuous;\r\nAuspicious sun and clouds;\r\nThe sky clears to reveal the moon.</I>",
