  "text": "This scene depicts the Christmas story: baby Jesus is surrounded by his parents Mary and Joseph, a shepherd holding a lamb, three wise men bringing precious gifts, and an angel. A woman in folkloric Mexican dress also holds a gift for the child and witnesses the event, bringing it to a more contemporary place and time. Josefina Aguilar adds whimsical touches to the traditional nativity scene through her charming depictions of people and animals, hand-formed with clay and painted with vibrant colors. Aguilar and several of her relatives are popular folk artists based in Oaxaca, Mexico.",
