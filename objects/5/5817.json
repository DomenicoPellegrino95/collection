  "text": "Ch'e Ming-yu, also known as Yeh-yun (\"Wild Clouds\") was born in Chang-ko, Honan province. A self-taught artist, he excelled in painting ink landscapes and figures. His style has much in common with the sixteenth century Che school painters like Chiang Sung (early 16th century), Chang Lu (about 1490-1563), and Wang Chao (early 16th century). Like many Che school paintings, the large size and bold technique suggest that the scroll was designed to be hung in a reception room. \r\n\r\nIn a summer scene set along the river, two men moor their boat. One pulls a rope holding the boat firm against the current while his companion drives a stake around which to tie the mooring line.",
