  "text": "Weaving technology used by urban Arab weavers was very sophisticated. A belt such as this, with its complicated and diverse patterning would probably have involved at least five specialists: a dyer to create the four warp colors, three coordinated weavers (one handling the weft thread and ground structure, and two developing the pattern), and a passementerie craftsperson to finish the braided warp ends and tassels.<P>\r\nFine wool weaving was made throughout North Africa and generally this production was used regionally, but urban Arab silk weavers frequently produced specialized textiles for a variety of communities in quite diverse locations.",
