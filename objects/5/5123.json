  "text": "The stone slabs that artists used to prepare ink were highly valued. The quarries at Hsi-hsien in Anhui province and at Tuan-chou in Kwangtung yielded fine slatelike stone that had the right porosity, hardness, and grain to make good grinding utensils. Many Ming and Ch'ing dynasty stones were embellished with carved d√©cor. This example has a cresting wave pattern on both the top and bottom surfaces. The bottom, shown here, includes a twenty-six-character inscription carved in archaistic script followed by the date 1623, signature, and seal of Wen Yu-yang.",
