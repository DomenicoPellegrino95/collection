  "text": "St. John the Baptist lived in the wilderness, with no comforts, preaching and baptizing the neophytes with the water of the river Jordan. His clothes were just a tunic of rough camel hair: however, here the same item is represented like a soft fur stole dragging on the floor, and the Saintâ€™s body is wrapped in an additional and very elegant floral fabric. The desert, where he lived, is transformed into a blossoming lawn: at the beginning of 15th century, Late Gothic elegance has supplanted the rigours of hermitic life.",
