  "text": "Heal Fabrics, which was based in England, produced bold graphic prints during the 1950s and 1960s. Generally fabrics such as this would be used for window treatments and furnishings. Fabrics like this were a dominating presence in an interior and were popular until the early 1970s, but by mid-decade there was a move away from the bold statement toward a more subdued elegance.",
