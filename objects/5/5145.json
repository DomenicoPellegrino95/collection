  "text": "Used in the ritual pouring of wine, these beakers are decorated on their flared necks with four elongated blades filled with an incised spiral motif, or <I>leiwen<I> pattern. The central zone is comprised of four <I>kui<I> (one horn) dragons separated by raised \"nose ridges\" between their round eyes, creating, in effect, a pair of symbolic <I>taotie<I> masks. The flared feet also display a <I>taotie<I> on either side of the vessel, though these are lacking the nose ridge. The overall incised lineal d√©cor seen here is associated with one of the stylistic phases documented from burials at Anyang, the last capital of Shang. The all-important <I>taotie<I> masks are hard to discern, however, and later, artisans developed a more plastic style with the masks distinctly cast in high relief against the incised spiral patterns. Although important burials during Shang frequently included pairs and sets of ritual vessels, they were often separated in the course of dispersal.",
