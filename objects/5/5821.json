  "text": "New York artist Tom Otterness is well known for his cartoon-like sculptures.  Mixing levity and discord, biology and social commentary, he has created fanciful and entertaining sculptural installations.  Most of his works have been generated as public art projects.  This drawing is a preparatory sketch for a sculpture which is part of the \"Life Underground\" series of 30 bronzes installed at the subway station at 8th Avenue and 14th Street in Manhattan.",
