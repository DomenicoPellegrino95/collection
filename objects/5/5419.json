  "text": "The house that William Gray Purcell designed for his family has a long, narrow plan, a 30-foot setback from the sidewalk, and walls of windows—very different from the homes of his neighbors, who “never wholly got used to it,” according to Purcell. Making the most of the narrow 50-by-150-foot city lot pushed Purcell and his architectural partner George Elmslie to their creative limits. The result is their most ambitious residential design. This model depicts the house around 1915, two years after the Purcells moved in.",
