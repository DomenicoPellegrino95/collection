  "text": "Italian designer Marte Stampale's untitled fabric exhibits both similarities and differences to the work of British designers in this show.  It features areas of bright, saturated color and crisp lines in its patterning, but this is where the similarities end.  Unlike the British designers, Stampale has made one large design the focus of this textile, rather than utilizing a repeating pattern.  Pockets of three-dimensional space are suggested within the multiple twisting and swirling lines; the design has the feel of early experiments in computer-aided design for three-dimensional forms and spaces.",
