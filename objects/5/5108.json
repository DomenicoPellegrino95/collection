  "text": "This rock, intended for the scholar's desk, is a special type of \"scenic\" stone that was valued by Japanese literati for its resemblance to the actual mountain ranges of China. Known as a \"near view\" stone, it features waterfalls crashing down jagged cliffs. Horizontal fissures mimic the narrow mountain paths and ledges scholars traversed in their enjoyment of nature. This microcosmic panorama, like ink landscapes, invites the viewer to wander the hills and valleys of the imaginary scene depicted. Mi Fei, the distinguished 11th-century Chinese scholar, arbiter of taste, and rock collector, wrote that he went on \"spirit journeys\" through the cavities of his rocks and inkwells. This belief in the restorative power of nature also inspired Japanese <I>nanga<I> artists during the 18th and 19th century.",
