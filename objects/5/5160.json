  "text": "Recognizable by the seated Buddha at the base of her conical crown, this superb early Bayon-style figure represents Prajnaparamita, the Buddhist goddess of transcendent wisdom. With eyes closed in cosmic meditation, she expresses the supreme bliss that comes from perfection of wisdom. Her relaxed physiognomy and sublime expression convey a sense of mystic divinity.\r\n<P>This image is associated with a small group of Bayon period statues purporting to be representations of Queen Jayavarman VII (r. 1181-1218). Custom has it that when the queen died prematurely, her older sister Indradevi commissioned statues of her in the guise of Prajnaparamita.",
