  "text": "This moulded tray would have been used as a receptacle to hold brushes during the writing or painting process. The shape of the vessel and its cobalt blue design elements, which appear to be stylized cloud motifs, are typical of the late 16th century, and the bottom bears a six-character Wan-li reign (1573-1620) mark in underglaze blue. Most likely made at Ching-te-chen, this tray is typical of a variety of porcelain writing implements including brush handles and brush rests that were made in both underglaze and overglaze enamels.",
