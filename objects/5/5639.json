  "text": "The large number of low tables that have survived suggest that they were not used exclusively on the heated kang platforms built into North China homes as their name implies. Paintings and woodblock illustrations show that they were also used on freestanding platforms and couches as well as out-of-doors in most parts of the country. Most kang tables are of corner-leg construction, and those with recessed legs of \"inserted-shoulder-joint\" construction like this one are relatively rare. As shown by the accompanying two tables, the basic design of this table was already established by the Sung dynasty (960-1279) and its popularity as an archaistic style continued through the Ming into the Ch'ing dynasty.",
