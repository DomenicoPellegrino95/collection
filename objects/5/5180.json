  "text": "<I>Kayagum<I>, a twelve string zither, is related to the Chinese <I>ch'in<I> and the Japanese <I>koto<I>.  It is played by plucking the strings with the right hand while depressing the strings for tonal variations with the left hand.  Such musical instruments were often elaborately embellished with mother-of-pearl inlay.  This <I>kayagum<I> has designs of flying cranes, symbols of longevity, and other auspicious symbols.",
