  "text": "According to Buddhist iconographical texts, the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara holds a long-necked vase or <I>kundika<I> from which the \"water of life\" is dispensed. Similarly, Buddhist priests sprinkle worshippers as a form of ritual ablution. The vessel is refilled using the hinged spout on the shoulder. The elegant shape of the <I>kundika<I> was so admired during the Koryo dynasty that potters also produced celadon vessels for decorative use among the aristocracy.",
