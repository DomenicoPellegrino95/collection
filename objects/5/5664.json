  "text": "This textile was inspired by English designer Owen Jones' drawings based on designs at the Alhambra, the amazing Moorish palace made by the Arabs when they controlled southern Spain. Elaborate designs with a suggestion of an exotic, foreign flavor were popular as wall coverings and interiors fabrics in Europe during the mid to late 19th century and were also desired by affluent purchasers in Middle Eastern and North African markets. Both England and France catered to these markets with designs and color combinations that related to local preferences for a dramatic statement and patterns with elements attuned to Islamic traditions, yet had a very contemporary aesthetic.",
