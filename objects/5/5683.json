  "text": "Dale Nichols' idyllic images of rural mid-western life are rooted in the artist's experiences as a boy growing up in Nebraska. His compositions are distillations of essential elements to which he imparted a sculptural quality through abstraction and simplification of forms - much in a manner that suggests the influence of the regionalist artist, Grant Wood.\r\n\r\nIn <i>The Twins<i>, the composition is dominated by two leafless trees that give the painting its title. Abstracted natural forms and crisp edges imbue this nostalgic view of farm life with a visual lucidity reminiscent of a dreamlike state.",
