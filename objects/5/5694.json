  "text": "Maher repeated decorative elements throughout a homeâ€™s architecture and furnishings, a somewhat obsessive approach to organic design. On the windows and glass doors of the Winton house, he liberally used an image of a poppy. This window was one of three over the main staircase, bringing light into the master bedroom closet. When the homeowners had the residence restored in the 1990s, they donated this window to the MIA. ",
