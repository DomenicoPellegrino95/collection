  "text": "Elevated platforms were amongst the earliest form of Chinese furniture. They were used as early as Han (206 b.c - a.d. 220) to elevate important persons above the floor thereby demonstrating their high social status at a time when seating was still at floor level for those of lower rank. Platforms became higher and larger during the Tang dynasty (618-906) being used as couches, beds, large tables and functioning for group activities like playing chess or examining antiques. These platforms were generally of box construction with floor stretchers but, by late Ming, with the popularization of tropical hardwoods, aristocratic taste shifted away from the archaic box platform style to newly fashionable daybeds, chuangs, and large tables constructed with freestanding legs. This may be the only huang-hua-li platform-style daybed in existence.",
