  "text": "Tsubaki Chinzan was a government official who became enamored with the painting modes of Chinese literati artists. He specialized in bird-and-flower themes and produced many delicately colored works in the \"boneless\" style (without ink outlines). As exemplified by this pair ot screens, however, some of Chizan's most elegant and evocative work was in pure ink. The right screen illustrates a grotto of epidendrum orchids--small unassuming plants which send forth a marvelous fragrance, just as bookish scholars \"blossom.\" The left screen pictures bamboo, admired for its strength in strong winds, just as a scholar is resolute in the face of stupidity and ignorance.",
  "description": "one of a pair of six-fold screens, ink on gold leafed paper; left 3 panels show close image of bamboo plant; right 3 panels bamboo grove at top as a background with continuation at lower quarter of left panels",
