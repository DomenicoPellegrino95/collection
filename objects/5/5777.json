  "text": "Large, extensively decorated burial jars like this have been recovered in recent decades. Limited to the area south of the Yangtze River in the Northern Chekiang and Southern Kiangsu province, they represent a vessel type and burial practices specific to this region. Made without lids, the jars display an extremely rich assortment of molded figures, animals, and architecture in a tiered arrangement comprising their upper portions.\r\n<P>The jars were most likely placed in the tomb so the soul of the deceased would have a place to reside. This accounts for a palace-like structure with entrance gates facing the four directions. The various figures at the top most likely represent Taoist immortals who somehow aided in the afterlife.",
