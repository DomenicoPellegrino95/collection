  "text": "Headrests were used throughout Oceania. Often regarded as status objects, headrests were important because they support the head, believed to be a person's spiritual center. In Fiji, headrests were reserved for chiefs and possibly helped to protect their elaborate hairstyles. The abstract form, balance, and grace of this carved headrest are exemplary of the sophisticated craftsmanship in Fijian art.",
