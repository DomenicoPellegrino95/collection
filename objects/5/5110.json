  "text": "This intricately carved lintel is a small sample of the exuberant sculpture that covered the temple's entire exterior.  The god Vishnu holds a discus and conch shell and appears seven times in various seated positions, sometimes on the back of his vehicle Garuda (an eagle that is frequently anthropomorphic), suggesting that the lintel originally crowned a large sculpture of Vishnu in the niche beneath it. The temple's architectural structure is reproduced  in the three shrines displayed on the lintel, an exquisite illustration of the precise relationship of the temple's individual parts to its whole. Musicians playing drums, horns, and cymbals make their way up the center of the arch, and gorgeous celestial beings emerge out of the mouths of mythical aquatic creatures <i>makaras<i> at either side.",
