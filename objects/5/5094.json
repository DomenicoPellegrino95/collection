  "text": "This elegant image of Shiva, identifiable through his piled dreadlocks, might have once been the principle deity within a shrine. His body forms a sinuous curve in <i>tribhanga<i> stance (triple-bend), and is dripping with jewelry and thin, gauzy garments.  Two pairs of auspicious celestial couples approach him with floral garlands in hand, moving towards his lotus-petal like halo.  His broken upper right hand once held a palm-leaf manuscript, the remains of which appear as a slightly curved, criss-crossed object.  ",
