  "text": "Born in Nanking, Kung Hsien studied painting with Tung Ch'i-chang (1555-1636) and literature with the Buddhist monk Chueh-lang Tao-sheng (1552-1659). Kung maintained loyalty to the fallen Ming dynasty under which he had been born and educated. When Manchus arrested his tutor Chueh-lang in 1647, Kung fled to Hai-an and did not return to Nanking until 1664. Deeply concerned with artistic legacy and aesthetic concepts, he developed a strongly personal style of form and images created with dark, heavily textured strokes and dots comprising graphically striking abstractions of light and dark. \r\n<P>The inscription reads:\r\n\r\n<P><I>Cloudy mountains soar indistinctly<I>\r\n<P><I>to the border where heaven begins;<I>\r\n<P><I>A solitary storied building below,<I>\r\n<P><I>truly holds the eye.<I>\r\n<P><I>I once asked where immortals' dwellings were located;<I>\r\n<P><I>Old ears (Lao tzu) wrote in his book,<I>\r\n<P><I>in the wine jar of the late Emperor<I>\r\n<P><I>Kung Hsien of Lu-ch'eng (\"City of Deer\")<I>\r\n\r\n<P>The reference to the \"city of deer\" is a metaphor for the imperial throne which, during much of Ming, had been located in Nanking.",
