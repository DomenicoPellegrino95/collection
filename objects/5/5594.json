  "text": "This textile by Barbara Brown depicts themes prevalent in 1970s design that had already begun to appear in the late 1960s.  Mathematical precision was key to creating textiles that coincidentally depicted the influence of machines and technology in their patterning.  By alternating light and shade, Brown created a sense of three-dimensionality and spiraling motion, as if this were a drill bit or other helical tool or fastener seen at close range.  This progressive motif won Heal's the Council of Industrial Design Award for Fabrics in 1970. ",
