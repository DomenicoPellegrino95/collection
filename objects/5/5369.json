  "text": "Shiva and Parvati together represent the ideal married couple. Shiva affectionately cups his wife's breast, while she sits on his lap with one arm draped over his shoulders.  Their two sons, Ganesha and Skanda stand beneath them on either side, and Shiva's bull vehicle, Nandi, sits obediently at their feet. The artist has depicted Durga's lion vehicle playfully batting at Nandi. Shiva holds his trident in his upper right hand, and his other two hands likely would have held a lotus and pot.  Parvati holds a moon-like mirror in her left hand, which would have illuminated the two gods in their beauty.  Above them two small temple shrines replicate the exterior form of the temple in which they were installed, and contain images of the gods Brahma and Vishnu.",
