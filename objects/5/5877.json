  "text": "Young Marquesan men used stilts during funerary and other ceremonies, performing acrobatics and staging mock battles with each other to show their athletic prowess.  The stilts themselves were five to six feet high, with fully carved steps like this one lashed to them about three feet up.  The figure under the decorated curve is a <I>tiki<I>, a depiction of the god of creation.  He is the principal Marquesan image, and almost every artwork from this region contains his stylized likeness.  The tiki is portrayed in the typical Polynesian stance, with his arms on his belly and thick legs slightly bent.  Combined with his large eyes, these characteristics show his power and readiness to act.",
