  "text": "Local artists Jan McKeachie-Johnston and Maren Kloppmann's ceramics represent two dramatically different aesthetics.  McKeachie-Johnston derives inspiration from an eclectic mix of historical sources - African pottery, Native American basketry, and contemporary Japanese ceramics - which are felt in the rich surface pattern, deep colors, and striking abstract form of this vessel.  \r\n\r\nIn contrast, the German-born Kloppmann is known for her modernist approach.  Symmetrical and geometric vessels like her Covered Box convey the clean, minimalist aesthetic of Europe in the 1930s, still appreciated today.\r\n",
