  "text": "Birds are important to the spiritual beliefs of North American Indian peoples.  They are attributed with the ability to deliver messages to and from the Creator.  The Native American Church has expanded this idea into a complex system of bird symbolism.  During meetings, participants hold feather fans, which help to send their prayers to the Creator.  Feathers are also used to transfer the positive energy of the sacrament, the ceremonial fire, and cedar smoke to worshippers.",
