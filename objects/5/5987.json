  "text": "While useful for the storage of small items, recessed-leg tables with drawers do not appear often in late Ming wood cuts or paintings and relatively few have survived. The late Ming edition of the <I>Lu Ban Ching<I> carpenter's manual does, however, illustrate a woman using a two drawer table like this one in combination with a mirror stand as a dressing table. The sumptious carving of flowering plum branches on the drawer fronts is decoration appropriate to women's furniture.",
