  "text": "The horizontal bottle is of a type produced on Mt. Keryong, in south-central Korea. When the early rulers of the Yi dynasty rejected Buddhism in favor of Confucianism, many monks were forced to return to secular life. The former monks of Keryong set up kilns and began to produce punch'ong with designs in iron oxide over a rapidly applied white slip, greatly admired for its intuitive spontaneity.",
