  "text": "This service may have been ordered to honor a wedding anniversary, as the scene depicts a middle-aged couple and their children in a garden. The design for the central scene on this service is perhaps unique, suggesting that Chinese painters may have been given an original amateur drawing. The border, copied from a design by the Austrian ceramic decorator Claudius Innocentius du Paquier (d. 1751), was popular on export porcelain of this period.",
