  "text": "Michallon was celebrated as a painting prodigy at 14 and later became the first teacher of the influential landscape painter Camille Corot. In 1817, when he was 20, he was awarded the first Prix de Rome for landscape painting by the French Academy for his picture A Woman Struck by Lightning, in which a person is crushed by a huge tree limb. This open-air study was probably an exercise painted in anticipation of that competition. ",
