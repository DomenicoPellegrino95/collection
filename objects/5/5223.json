  "text": "The finely painted enamel decoration of this copper plate features a picnicking European couple.  Where Europeans are finely painted during the Kangxi and Yongzheng periods, it is always possible that such scenes were made as much for the educated Chinese as for export.  They display idealized scenes of Western life in the same way that idealized scenes of Chinese life were popular in Europe.  Such a piece would likely have been bought by a private trader as a speculative purchase from a Chinese merchant in Canton.",
