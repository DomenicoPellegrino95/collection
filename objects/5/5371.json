  "text": "During the Kofun period, huge burial mounds were constructed for powerful clan leaders. Clay cylinders and figures, known as <i>haniwa</i>, were placed around the periphery of the mound to signify the sanctity of the area. This female figure wears a necklace of magatama, claw- or fang-shaped jewels of special talismanic power. There are also traces of red pigment on her cheeks, indicating tattoos or ceremonial face-paint. Judging from other examples, she would have worn a wide, flat hairdo which extended over her forehead. She also once held a cup with her broken right arm - another indication that she was responsible for formulating medicinal or magical potions. It is likely, therefore, that she represents a shaman, a respected position in early Japanese society.",
