  "text": "This haniwa represents a female figure. Her necklace of <i>magatama</i> (claw- or fang-shaped jewels of special talismanic power), tells us that she is a shrine attendant, a respected position in early Japanese society. Traces of red pigment on her cheeks indicate tattoos or ceremonial face-paint. Originally she would have worn a wide, flat hairdo that extended over her forehead and would have held a cup with her broken right arm, an indication that she was responsible for formulating medicinal or magical potions.",
