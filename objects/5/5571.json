  "text": "Sarah Hardistyâ€™s moccasins combine considerable warmth and superb artistic expression through the use of materials local to the Dene, who live near the Arctic Circle. She crafted moose hide and beaver fur because these animals were abundant and their hides provide good insulation against cold and moisture. Porcupines provided quills that the artist, a master of quillwork, stained and worked into complex patterns for vamp decoration.\r\n\r\nAward winning artist Jamie Okuma has showcased traditional Native American materials, skills and patterns with Adaptation II. She has meticulously beaded and quilled a pair of designer Christian Louboutin stilettos, augmented by chicken feathers and deer hide, in a contemporary version of highly decorated moccasins.",
