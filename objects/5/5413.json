  "text": "This pair of scissors is made from a single piece of silver. The \"figure eight\" shape of the handle acts as a spring for the cutting motion. Relatively few pre-T'ang scissors survive and most that do are made of iron. Several decorated silver pairs have been unearthed from the T'ang tombs, however, indicating the increased prosperity of that dynasty. The sumptuous and luxurious life of the aristocracy is reflected in tomb goods such as this, which, transcending its mundane functional purpose, attracts and delights the eye with its decorative content.",
