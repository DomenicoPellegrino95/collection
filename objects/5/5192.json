  "text": "This tabletop cosmetic cabinet with removable front panel can be dated reliably to the mid-sixteenth century. This popular type of cabinet was also made in hardwood with hinged doors throughout the Ming and Ch'ing dynasties. The box is decorated with a richly orchestrated scheme of symbolic plants and animals. The cartouches on the top and sides display the auspicious phoenix and cranes amongst clouds. The carved d√©cor also includes symbols of long life--the <I>shou<I> character, <I>ling-chih<I> fungus, and peaches--and the \"three friends of winter\" (pine, bamboo, prunus), which represent perseverance and virtue. The cabinet is a product of the official workshops of the Chia-ching era. On its base is an engraved and gilded mark reading <I>T'a Ming Chia-ching nian chih<I> (made in the Chia-ching reign of the great Ming).",
