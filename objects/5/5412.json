  "text": "Tantric practitioners rely on sacred manuscripts to impart the teachings of a deity.  In this case, the manuscript, which is essentially a philosophical work on the nature of <i>prajna<i> (wisdom), produced the representation of the deity, Prajnaparamita, who personifies the text. She is depicted in the center of the elaborately carved wooden cover as a goddess holding a book and vajra in her upper hands, and flanked by Green Tara on her proper left, and Avalokiteshvara on her right. The book manuscript would have been protected by two wooden covers, which in turn were wrapped in cloth.",
