  "text": "Ethiopia was the first nation in Africa to adopt Christianity when King Ezana made it the state religion in the early 4th century. Crosses are among the best-known items of Christian Ethiopian art; nowhere else are there as many different styles. These two examples are fashioned in brass and would have been mounted on long wood poles, to be carried during processions. They date from the 15th century.  Remarkably vibrant in color, the large icon in diptych form dates from around 1700. Its size made it suitable for processions and ritual displays. Like all Ethiopian icons, it is composed according to a fixed pattern -- see the adjacent label for more information.",
