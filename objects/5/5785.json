  "text": "In the Sui and early T'ang dynasties (6th and 7th centuries) slenderness and grace epitomized the feminine ideal. By the eighth century, however, a new concept of beauty emerged and heavy-set palace ladies are shown in early eighth century mural paintings and tomb sculptures such as this. The fashion for plumpness seems to have persisted well into the Sung dynasty (11th-12th century). Numerous figurines similar to this one have been excavated from T'ang tombs in Shensi province. It seems likely that this figurine also came from that region.",
