  "text": "Gu Yide was the nephew of Gu Zhengyi, founder of the Huating school of painting in Jiangsu province and teacher of the great literatus Dong Qichang. All three artists were advocates of Yuan (14th century) style ink painting and Dong's own colophon appears at the end of this exceptional painting. Many paintings by Gu passed into the hands of Dong Qichang (1555-1636), who would have appreciated Gu's historical allusion to the great Yuan dynasty master Zhao Mengfu. This long, carefully brushed landscape is considered one of Gu's finest handscrolls. In spite of its historical reference, it is unmistakeably Ming in conception and execution with its emphasis on the formal aspects of brush and ink work.",
