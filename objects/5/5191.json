  "text": "This rare softwood table is one of the few examples of pre-Yuan dynasty furniture in the West. It is probably a small offering table built specifically for the tomb rather than an object for daily use. Made during the Liao dynasty (907-1125), around the time that the shift from floor-level seating to chairs had taken place, it forms a link between the softwood furniture made before the Liao period and that which followed in softwood lacquer and tropical hardwoods. The recessed leg construction and shaped legs with \"incense stick moulding down their centers,\" bear resemblance to the early fifteenth century lacquer table shown here. This basic form of recessed leg construction survived as a traditional style through the Ming period and endured even longer in Shansi province.",
