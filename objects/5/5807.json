  "text": "The pictorial subject of decoration on this large basin is not found in earlier examples of cloisonné. For the first time, beginning in the late 16th century, artisans show a variety of plants and animals, as well as human figures, in generic landscape or garden settings. Influenced by subjects popular in paintings, figural scenes had appeared in lacquer and porcelain over a hundred years earlier. This basin has finely divided enamel colors and precisely placed wire designs in the rim and ground pattern which serve to emphasize the group of scholars shown here in various activities such as ch'in playing, scroll painting and chess playing.",
