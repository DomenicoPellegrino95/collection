  "text": "Chang Jui-t'u, one of the best Ming calligraphers, was a highly respected painter and one-time grand secretary. He received his <I>chu-jen<I> degree in 1603 and, in 1607, placed third in the palace examinations and became a compiler in the Han-lin Academy. He served the court as vice-minister of rites and eventually in the secretariat. In this handscroll, Chang has written three poems from a sequence of eight entitled <I>Ch'iu-hsing<I> (<I>Autumn Meditations<I>), composed in 766 by the eminent Tang poet Tu Fu. Writing in running cursive script (<I>hsing-ts'ao<I>), Chang exhibited wide variation in the size and components of his characters and used exceptionally rhythmic brush pressure and fluent connecting strokes. His highly expressive characters approach the abstract.\r\n",
