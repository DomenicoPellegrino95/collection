  "text": "Here the artist revels in texture. The beauty of the handspun wool is uninterrupted by color and shadows created by the folds of cloth further enhance the textural experience.\r\n\r\nThe overlapping folds of cloth were created and secured in place while the fabric was on the loom. In essence, the artist created two different lengths of cloth at the same time. During the weaving process the cloths were periodically joined into one structure. The longer fabric would overlap and in doing so created folds.",
