  "text": "A leading figure in both New York and Paris Dada, and later in Surrealism, Man Ray worked in several media exploring the concept of the \"found object\" - treating discarded materials as valued artifacts. Many of these objects recur over many years in a range of the artist's work. The motif of the unwinding swath of paper first appeared in Man Ray's controversial Dada sculpture of 1919, <I>Lampshade</I>, in which an unrolled paper lampshade curled around a metal shaft. He returned to the motif in four subsequent works, three of which are titled <I>Return to Reason</I>. This painting is the earliest. A three minute film followed in 1923, and a larger version of our painting was executed in 1939.",
