  "text": "Ch'en Shun, one of the most important Ming dynasty calligraphers and flower painters, was born into a modestly prosperous literati family. His first teacher was the great literatus, Wen Cheng-ming (1470-1559), and between 1519 and 1523 he studied at the Imperial Academy in Peking. While initially influenced by the writing style of Wen Cheng-ming, Ch'en quickly developed a personal approach based more on the calligraphy of the ancient masters Mi Fu (1051-1107) and Yang Ning-shih (873-954). His running and cursive scripts (<I>ts'ao-shu<I>) for which he is most famous display characteristic fluidity, boldness, and exuberance.\r\n<P>The frontispiece to the handscroll is written by Ch'en's friend and teacher Wen Cheng-ming, leader of the Wu school. Wen's four-character title reads:\r\n<P><I>Pai Yang (Ch'en Shun) the sage of cursive script<I>\r\n<P>In these three ancient poems Ch'en writes with the exuberant fluidity that made him, along with Chu Yun-ming (1461-1527) and Wen Cheng-ming, one of the most important Ming masters of <I>ts'ao-shu<I> script.",
