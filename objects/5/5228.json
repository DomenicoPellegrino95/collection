  "text": "As a result of rampant speculation in trade, many financial scandals occurred between 1718 and 1722. At that time, the commedia dell'arte, or Italian Comedy, was popular throughout Europe. In an effort to quell the fear that speculators would destroy Holland's wealth, the Dutch East India Company commissioned a series of six plates in Chinese porcelain with scenes and characters from the Italian Comedy intended to discourage such speculation. Two of the six plates are shown here. The designs for these plates may have been copied from delftware plates brought to China as models, or the company may have supplied the decorators with original drawings.",
