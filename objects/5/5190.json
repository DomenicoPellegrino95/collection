  "text": "In the colder parts of North China, a large heated brick or tamped earth platform about three feet high was built into many houses. The kang, as it was called, contained a system of flues connected to a stove and, during the winter months, most activities including eating, lounging, and sleeping, took place on this warm, comfortable surface. These activities required sitting cross-legged, kneeling, or semi-reclining and a variety of low furniture was evolved to accomodate these postures. Richly carved in high relief, this kang table is one of a larger group of tables and beds that feature a lion mask at the shoulder of each cabriole leg.",
