  "text": "Hung Wu, a grandson of the Kangxi emperor, was an accomplished poet, calligrapher, and painter. His fluid and sensitive brushwork distinguishes his best work from that of contemporary court painters. He modeled his flower studies after those of Chen Chun (1483-1544) and his poetry after the verse of Tao Yuanming (365-427). Hong, who signed these lines with the pen name Shuzhai, has inscribed this elegant fan painting with Tao Yuanming in mind:\r\n\r\n<I>The shifting shadows of many branches\r\nA hundred feet of pure breeze\r\nThese two men (Tao Yuanming, Wang Huizhi),\r\nso far beyond the common crowd;\r\nPeacefully, with poetic thoughts, I paint the mid-autumn. \r\nI painted this picture of \"immortal tree\" (bamboo) and\r\n\"longevity guest\" (chrysanthemums) for Master Yunlu.<I>",
