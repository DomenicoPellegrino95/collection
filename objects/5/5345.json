  "text": "Georges Hugnet's \"Surrealist Couple\" is a prime example of surrealist-inspired collage. Active as a poet, playwright, art critic, and graphic artist, Hugnet was a prominent member of the Surrealists from 1932 to 1939. His favorite medium was photo-collage, in which he would reassemble portions of printed photographic images he clipped from magazines and newspapers of the day. Yet, instead of allowing us to recognize the objects and images, he emphasized their strangeness and incompatibility. The head of the man is a top hat resting on a bowler, while his body is a cut-out image of a doorway. The woman's costume consists of images of dresses and an illustration of a fantastic headdress. The towering termite mound behind them is equally disconcerting. Like a dream, the assembled image thwarts our attempts at rational perception and understanding.",
