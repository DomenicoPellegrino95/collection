  "text": "This mei mask represents a male ancestor of a Iatmul clan and would have been used for male initiation ceremonies. The elaborate design of encrusted cowrie shells frames the two-toned face and covers the beak-like mouth. When worn for a ceremonial dance, the mask was part of a large costume decorated with feathers, leaves, and other ornaments. Mei masks belonged to the clan and were stored in the homes of clan elders when not in use.",
