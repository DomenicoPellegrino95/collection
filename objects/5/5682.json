  "text": "The Jains believe in a group of twenty-four \"teacher-liberators\" (Jinas), also known as <I>tirthankaras<I> or \"ford-makers\" who ford the gulf between the phenomenal world and \"liberation\" (moksha). While both Buddhists and Jains were advocates of nonviolence toward all sentient beings and rejected the Hindu caste system, the Jains stressed the importance of austere and rigorous ascetic practices more than the Buddhists. The Digambara order (\"sky-clad\" or \"naked\") believed that all possessions, by fostering an attachment to the material world, were a hindrance to spiritual liberation. Accordingly, Digambara monks do not wear clothes and images of the Jinas, like this small one, intended for a domestic altar, are depicted naked.",
