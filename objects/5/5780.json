  "text": "Chinese craftsmen made silver as well as porcelain for the export markets in the West. Sunshing, a Chinese silversmith working on New China Street in Canton, found favor with the Salem, Massachusetts merchant Benjamin Shreve. Western merchants often provided potters and silversmiths with European examples to be copied. This tea service is closely based on an English model with some alterations. The slop bowl, which is usually a circular bowl in English silver, appears here in the same form as the sugar bowl, while the creamer echoes the form of the teapot.",
