  "text": "Box in a Valise is essentially a miniature portable museum of the work of Marcel Duchamp. It consists of 68 separate photographic reproductions and miniature replicas of the artist's most important works. Based on an idea Duchamp developed in 1936, the first boxes were assembled by Duchamp in 1941 and smuggled out of France during the Nazi occupation. In an era of mass emigration and political terror, the idea of packing up all of one's artworks in a suitcase would have seemed particularly practical. Like a museum installation, each work has a label identifying its title, medium, date, and, in many cases, its owner. Assembled in 1961, this copy of Box in a Valise is one of 300 produced by Duchamp or his relatives between 1941 and 1971. Despite its reproductive nature, this fascinating work stands as one of Duchamp's most complex and challenging artistic statements.",
