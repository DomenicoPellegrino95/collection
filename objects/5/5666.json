  "text": "This art glass lamp was once part of the furniture at a Minneapolis store that sold phonographs, or record players. Along with rectilinear furniture and spare interior design, such lamps were intended to make the shop seem cutting edge, an early attempt to market a product with integrated design. It may have gone too far. The unified ultra-modern design made the phonograph cabinets, still old-fashioned-looking, seem antiquated by comparison, even though they housed the latest technology.",
