  "text": "Francis Yellow applied the traditional Plains pictographic style to create this piece.  Like this work, many historical painted animal hides were depicted with the action moving from right to left. The artist uses a name glyph to identify each rider's traditional name instead of using the assigned English name.  Yellow depicts mounted Native people in traditional outfits running people down. These people represent academics, teachers, and scientist who hold books that relate to their study of Native American people.  As the horses overtake those on foot, they yell non-traditional names of Native tribes.\r\n\r\nWhile visiting the Peabody Museum, a museum known for its large ethnographic collection, Francis Yellow requested a copy of their cultural term list.  This list corresponds the inappropriate name for Native American tribes with the names that the tribes call themselves.",
