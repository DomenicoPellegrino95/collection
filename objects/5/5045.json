  "text": "Solidly constructed from ample timber with minimal decoration, this long table has everted flanges at each end of its solid plank top suggesting its use as an \"altar table.\" Ming period illustrations, however, provide ample evidence that these long, narrow tables were not used exclusively in domestic worship but also functioned for the display of precious antiques, seasonal flowers, and incense paraphernalia. In this case, the table has been set with a celadon incense burner and formally positioned in front of two protective wall panels built into the end wall of the reception hall specifically to act as a backdrop to an altar setting.",
