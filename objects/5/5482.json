  "text": "Made with separate top and bottom sections, compound storage cabinets were large and imposing forms especially when arranged in pairs. In terms of their construction, these cabinets fall within the group called \"square-cornered,\" a type that typically employed prominent flush-mounted hardware hinges and decorative lock escutcheons. Ming dynasty literature makes more mentions of lacquer furniture than it does hardwood, and it is known that both lacquer and hardwood furniture could be used in the same household. The black lacquer ground of this cabinet has been decorated in polychromy with a landscape of women engaged primarily in literati pursuits, such as playing the <I>ch'in<I>, examining antiques, enjoying nature, and composing poetry.",
