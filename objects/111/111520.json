  "text": "The earliest culture in Japan, the Jo_mon, was gradually displaced by the more sophisticated and technologically advanced Yayoi (ca. 300 BCE-ca.300 CE). Yayoi pottery was produced in a wide range of standardized shapes. In general, Yayoi vessels are distinguished by their simple and elegant designs that emphasize the shape of the vessel rather than surface embellishment.These chaste forms were coil built, but finished on the potter's wheel, giving them their graceful symmetry and a heightened sense of drama with boldly swelling bodies, flaring necks, and attenuated rims. Their surfaces were further finished by burnishing with a spatula, imparting a smooth, slightly polished effect. This example was probably produced in Northern Kyushu during the Middle Yayoi period.",
