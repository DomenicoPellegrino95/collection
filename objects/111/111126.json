  "text": "While his close friend Paul Gauguin was radically flattening his forms, Claude-Émile Schuffenecker stayed on his own quiet, post-impressionist path. That may be why Gauguin ultimately disdained him, and why history neglects him. Artistically, he was more drawn to Degas. The scholar Jill-Elyse Grossvogel sees Schuffenecker’s reserved, undemanding personality mirrored in his soft, ethereal marks. He also seems of have adopted the sinuous tree limbs of Van Gogh, whose work he collected.  ",
