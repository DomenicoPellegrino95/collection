  "text": "Klein’s specialization is turning on a small scale, especially with ornamental turning lathes that produce fascinating surface textures. This Spin-Top Box with Small Top was turned on an ornamental lathe called a Lawler lathe, which allows the turner to carve very precise curvilinear patterns. The surface of the box and top show the complexity possible with an ornamental lathe. The tiny top is revealed when the top of the larger box is removed. Both the box and the small top are functional spinning tops.",
