  "text": "This set was made in Straubing (Bavaria) for the chapel of nearby castle Kapfing. With angels holding the instruments of Christ's passion (<I>arma Christi</I>) on the cup, and sophisticated <I> alla grottesca</I> decoration on the oval cartouches between them, the chalice epitomizes Bavarian silversmithing in the age of the Counter-Reformation. The chalice's decoration unfolds on the basis of threesomes -- see for instance the three heads of cherubs on its base. This symbolism of the number three refers to the theological dogma of the Trinity of God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.",
