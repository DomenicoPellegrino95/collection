  "text": "Kalabari men and women of Nigeria occasionally wear a unique cloth called pelete bite, which is created by altering fabrics imported from India. Starting with existing striped or checked patterns, new designs are made by cutting parts of the white threads with a razor and removing them. A few cut threads are still visible on this example. The technique also produces little holes, adding to the visual effect. The newly created motifs have descriptive names; here, for example, abili (checker board) and etere (mat). \r\n\r\nThe women who create pelete bite are important figures in Kalabari society: artists, innovators, and entrepreneurs. Their art transforms imported cloth into a cultural symbol.",
  "description": "Indigo stripes on red run vertically and horizontally across the textile near edges and across center area; thin lines, woven with white thread, create square grid patterning",
