  "text": "Family Portrait is a group of interconnected, black-painted wood and thorn figures, whose heads are tiny, functional boxes. Sengel sees the “prickliness” as characteristic of many family gatherings. He explains his motivation: \r\n“Leafing through an old family photo album and then seeing a batch of locust thorns that I had stuck into a piece of foam board led me to the idea of this piece. Despite the darker, ominous associations of black thorns, an element of whimsy was irrepressible here. I see this as portrait, caricature, silhouette…it is still one of my favorites.”",
