  "text": "Standing at almost human scale, each of these sculptures has a distinct, individual character. Yamada calls them morices, part of an interlocking joint, and as a group their power is compounded; they hold a fascinating aura as if guarding some secret history or memory. Their polished white ceramic \"bodies\" convey a purity of form and spirit that showcases Yamada’s supreme mastery of his materials. \r\nYamada’s morices bridge the work of two outstanding and very different sculptors from the early 20th century, paying tribute to Marcel Duchamp’s ideas and Constantine Brancusi’s devotion to pure form. With simplicity and abstraction, Yamada is able to show these fundamental divergences in 20th-century art. ",
