  "text": "The eerie cry of a whistle is one thing, but an orchestra of dozens of whistles played at a funeral evokes the Otherworld. The whistle is in the stylized shape of a person wearing a prestige cap popular in the Cameroonian Grasslands, and can also be played individually to invoke personal protection.",
