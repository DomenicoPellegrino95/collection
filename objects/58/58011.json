  "text": "This high chair was chosen as the symbol for [I]\"Turning\" Over Time: Historic Seating Furniture[I] becuase of the exceptional skill of the turner who made it.  Each of the chair's parts, from the middle stretcher and legs to the arm spuuorts and spindles, is a different design element that artfully comes together to produce a predominately turned object.  The beauty of the chair is enhanced by its original dark red and black paint, accented with striping and gold paint on the turnings.  The chair descended in the Pakrer Mayhew family of New Bedford and Martha's Vineyard, Massachusettes, and is likely to have been made in one of those regional cabinetmaking centers.",
