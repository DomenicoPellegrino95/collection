  "text": "The Fourth Duke of Marlborough commissioned Sir William Chambers to design a large silver service for Blenheim Palace near Oxford, England, including sixteen of these \"fine festoon sauce boats.\"  Through his book, Civil Architecture (1759), and designs for Somerset House and George III's Kew Gardens, Chambers had the greatest impact of any English architect in the second half of the 18th century, with the possible exception of Robert Adam.  In date and design, these sauce boats' innovative design mark the introduction of Neoclassical design in Europe, and illustrate the high status of silver.",
