  "text": "Several types of white ware were manufactured in different parts of China during the T'ang dynasty (618-906). Some vessels with rather elaborate low-relief ornamentation show the strong influence of Persian metalwork, but a jar such as this, severely plain with robust form, relies entirely on its smooth flow of uncluttered surface and pure white glaze for its aesthetic appeal.\r\n<P>The progression from porcelaneous stoneware to true porcelain occurred during the T'ang dynasty. Porcelains with hard, dense, impervious white, translucent bodies and hard glazes were achieved when white kaolin clays refined with feldspar were fired in excess of 1250Â° C. T'ang white ware have been found at kiln sites in Szechwan, Shensi, Shansi, Hopei, Honan, Anhui, and Kiangsi provinces. The modern Ching-te-chen in Kiangsi was to become the center of all porcelain production in the Yuan dynasty (1280-1368).\r\n",
