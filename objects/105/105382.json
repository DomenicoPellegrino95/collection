  "text": "A millennia old art form, Plains Indian drawings appear on rocks, hides, muslin, cloth, and paper. Drawings can depict a variety of subjects, including great accomplishments of individual men, important historical events, and ceremonial and daily life on the Plains. Kiowa artist Koba made this sketchbook—illustrating his life before and during captivity—while a prisoner of war at Ft. Marion, Florida between 1875 and 1878. Offering a glimpse into the artists' world, these drawings provide rich information about Kiowa perspectives and aesthetic sensibilities.",
