  "text": "Ilya Schor fled Poland for New York in 1941, continuing his work as a gold and silversmith specializing in jewelry and Judaica.  Schor's influence was rooted in his European Jewish background, particularly pre-Holocaust life in the shtetl (village) beyond the Eastern European Pale of Settlement.  This mezuzah cover features Jews in traditional dress surrounded by stylized tulips, animals, and scrollwork.  Made to attach to the doorpost of a home or synagogue, the cover holds a parchment scroll containing the text of the Shema from Deuteronomy 6:4-9 that begins, \"Hear, Israel, the Lord is Our God, the Lord is One.\"",
