  "text": "Painter and printmaker Sean Scully began his career in the 1960s as a Minimalist, emphasizing linear and hard-edged geometric compositions. In the 1980s, he turned away from this approach, dissatisfied with the emotional detachment and objectivity of Minimalism. Building on the limited geometric vocabulary of his earlier work, Scully manipulated color, tone, texture, and the layering of forms to infuse his abstractions with a rich emotional tenor, a characteristic underscored by his use of evocative titles. \r\n\r\nSotto Voce exemplifies Scully's skills as a printmaker. Here, he exploits the subtleties of various tonal intaglio processes to achieve an intensely physical composition that tantalizingly hints at representation. \r\n",
