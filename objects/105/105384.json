  "text": "A.L. Jewell & Company was one of three earliest manufacturers to capitalize on the popularity of weathervanes in nineteenth-century America, making primarily three-dimensional weathervanes by hand-hammering sheet copper into wooden forms.  This rare Jumping Horse form was only made in small numbers over about a three-year period, with the horse jumping through a hoop being the most rare.  While portraits of famous harness racers were extremely popular at the time, this vane portrays a stylized, whimsical horse in motion.",
