  "text": "Camille Pissarro was a founding father of Impressionism. His initial conception of the present scene was made with aquatint, resulting in a dreamy, foggy image. At this juncture, he printed a few proof impressions, such as the one shown here. The freedom and abstraction would have seemed radical to Pissarroâ€™s contemporaries. He found it interesting and perhaps pleasing enough to preserve examples in this form; yet, he saw it as unfinished. \r\n \r\nPissarro continued to work on the plate, scratching it with his drypoint needle and adding compositional elements, such as the two people and the steaks of rain that give the image its name, eventually giving greater substance and definition to the forms. Despite the technical sophistication of his process, he managed to keep the scene disarmingly modest and seemingly spontaneous.",
