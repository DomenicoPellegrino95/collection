  "text": "In 1711 the Jewish ghetto of Frankfurt was destroyed by fire, prompting a resurgence of Jewish ceremonial art commissions.  Roger Herfurth, a Christian silversmith, was uniquely positioned to take advantage of this demand, creating more than thirty documented works of ceremonial art for Jewish patrons.  His Hanukkah lamp design features a chest-shaped container for oil, a solid back plate ornamented with repouss√© shells and scrolls surrounding a Temple menorah, and rampant lions flanking a crowned cartouche.  This form became so popular that it was replicated well into the 19th century and is still referred to as the \"Frankfurt type.\"     ",
