  "text": "Chang Ch'eng-lung from Kai-feng, developed a mastery of various Ming painting styles but eventually evolved a syncretic manner of his own. He was technically accomplished, capable of exquisite fine-line painting but equally of lofty, magnificently conceived archaic landscapes. This large painting displays a range of fantastic mountains towering above a group of literati recluses gathered together on a pavilion to survey the dense bamboo forest and beyond that an extraordinarily, complex array of waterfalls. Above and beyond these unlikely water courses loom the dark magnificently imposing peaks. The bazaar mountain elements recall the great eccentric landscapist, Wu Pin (act.1568-1621), while the foreground figural group suggests the stylization of Li Shih-Ta (act. 1580-1620), another great Ming dynasty model. Throughout this impressive tour de force, Chang adds dramatic and original compositional elements of his own. Few paintings by Chang Ch'eng-lung have survived and this beautifully rendered work is one of his finest.",
