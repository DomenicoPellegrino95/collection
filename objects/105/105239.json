  "text": "Ch'in Lien is recorded as a landscape and figure painter who \"captured the appearance and bearing\" of the Yuan (1280-1368) masters. He lived in Nanking, during the K'ang-hsi period (1662-1723) and was a pupil of Fan I. This large scale hanging scroll would have served as a <I>chang-t'ang<I>, the primary painting displayed in a reception hall where it was usually centered above the main altar table. The work depicts a visiting literatus on his mule with attendants following him. He is paused before a wooden bridge overlooking a rushing stream as he approaches a rural retreat hidden in swirling mists and damp trees. Huge mountains swathed in clouds tower formlessly above the scene. The generic subject of pleasant towering landscapes was a common theme in <I>chang-t'ang<I> paintings.  They evoked a sense of universal harmony.\r\n<P>The scroll is signed \"imitating the painting style of Kao Fang-Shan (Kao K'o-Kung 1248-1310 the expressionistic Yuan dynasty master), dated to the summer month of the Kuen-mao cyclical year (1663): Shih-yu, Chin Lieu.  With two seals of the painter, Chin Yin and Wen-Shui.\r\n",
