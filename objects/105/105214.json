  "text": "Ellsworth Kelly distills the observed and experienced world into abstracted forms or fragments. He articulates these reductive geometric forms in sculpture, paintings, and prints, by emphasizing their physical and material qualities-size, shape, color, mass, edges, and surface texture. The result, as seen in this monochromatic lithograph, is elegant in its stark simplicity and conceptual refinement. ",
