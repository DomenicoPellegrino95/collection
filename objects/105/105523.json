  "text": "Even in works as late as A Tanner Smoking His Pipe, artists used the worker as a figural type to portray the lower classes' eternal struggle for survival. Lucien Ott's\r\ntreatment of a tanner, caught in a moment of relaxation amid the trappings of his trade, demonstrates just how significant had been the ability of artists throughout the 19th century to depict types of workers, the common people of a country, and thereby create artwork accessible to the broadest possible public. The existence of drawings like Ott's shows that a realist tradition persisted at a time of extreme changes in society and of modernist modifications to visual representation.\r\n",
