  "text": "A native of  St. Louis, Missouri, Miller was one of many American artists who sought to broaden their experience in France.  Arriving in Paris in 1898, he soon relocated to the American artists' colony that had sprung up around the home of the French impressionist, Claude Monet.   The thriving expatriate community counted Frederick Frieseke, Guy Rose, and Lawton Parker in their number-all of whom were devoted to the impressionist aesthetic.\r\n\r\nMiller only left France once the hostilities of World War I had commenced (1914), and eventually took up residence in Provincetown, Massachusetts by 1917, where he became known as the \"dean\" of the community of artists gathered there.\r\n",
