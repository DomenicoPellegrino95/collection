  "text": "The Buddha can be recognized by several auspicious marks, most prominently the ushnisha, a cranial protuberance that in this sculpture appears as a coiffed bun, and the urna, a tuft of hair in between his eyes. On the pedestal, the Hindu gods Brahma and Indra flank the meditating Buddha.   After renouncing a comfortable royal life, the Buddha attained enlightenment and preached sermons that advocated a life of non-attachment. \r\n\r\nThis sculpture is from Gandhara, a historical region that is now northwest Pakistan. Much has been said about Gandharan artâ€™s close affinities with Greek and Roman art, evidenced by the flowing folds of robes and chiseled facial features. Indeed Greek troops occupied the area in 330 BCE; however, Indian, Persian, and Central Asian forces also established a presence there between 300 BCE and 460 CE. Trade provided the ultimate incentive for all travelers, as Gandhara occupies a central location along the caravan routes that connected China to the West.   \r\n\r\n",
