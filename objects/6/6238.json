  "text": "Low-fired clay cylinders known as <I>haniwa<I> were arranged around the crests of vast burial mounds. The greatest number are simple cylinders like this one, while a smaller percentage were sculpted into human and animal forms. Scholars still debate the precise function of these objects. Some believe that they demarcated the sacred boundary of the tomb, while others think they were used to prevent erosion of the freshly mounded earth. This example was excavated at Misu, in Okayama Prefecture of central Japan.",
