  "text": "U.S. Army Captain Seth Eastman was a trained artist who served twice on the frontier at Minnesota’s Fort Snelling, from 1830 to 1832 and again from 1841 to 1848. His extensive firsthand, peaceful encounters with Native Americans gave him extraordinary opportunities to observe their customs and practices, which he documented in his art. He became known as the “pictorial historian of the Indian.”\r\n\r\nThis watercolor belongs to an extensive series that he made between 1849 and 1855 to illustrate Henry Rowe Schoolcraft’s monumental six-volume study, Historical and Statistical Information Respecting the History, Condition and Prospects of the Indian Tribes of the United States. Mia’s 35 watercolors and drawings for the project represent an astounding array of subjects: muskrat hunting, fish spearing, pest control, rice gathering, sugaring, courtship, marriage, shelter, travel, medicine, menstruation, mourning, dancing, warfare, government, topography, demographics, language, and music. With such variety and Eastman’s well-informed clarity of depiction, they constitute an unparalleled visual account of native ways in our region.\r\n\r\nThis picture-perfect chief looks like he was just inserted here from a more formal picture. He isn’t even looking at anyone, though he is supposed to be giving a reprimand. More likely, the artist used the council theme as an excuse to make candid portraits of these Dakota villagers. Many brought their long-stemmed pipes, signs of hospitality.\r\n\r\nThe blue-and-white striped blanket worn by the figure seated below the person in orange (standing near the chief) could be a Hudson Bay blanket, underscoring the cosmopolitan exchange of goods that characterized the lives of Native people. Far from static or isolated, they benefited from lively trade routes that brought the world’s goods to their door. They also bent those goods to their own creative ends. The seated figure near the tipi’s flap showed his individualism by sticking feathers in the top of a fedora. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
