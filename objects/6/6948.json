  "text": "Founded in 1852 as a jewelry shop, Shreve & Co. expanded into a manufacturing firm that produced work of exceptional craftsmanship and design. As with numerous firms of the period, the designer of this work remains unknown. The simplified, unadorned shapes championed by the reformist Arts and Crafts designers were well suited for machine aided production and became one of the company's specialities. Typical of this kettle-on-stand, Shreve reserved hammering for its finest work usually indicating that it was finished by hand.",
