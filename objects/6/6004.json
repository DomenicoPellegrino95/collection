  "text": "Xie Daoling, from Suzhou in Jiangsu province, was known for his bird-and-flower compositions as well as landscapes done in old styles. Much of his pictorial vocabulary was derived from Shen Zhou (1427-1509), founder of the Wu or Suzhou school of painting.\r\n\r\nAttended by a servant carrying a basket of herbs, a scholar pauses on a bridge beneath a pine tree gazing upwards toward his destination, a monastery visible in the mist of a distant valley. Gathering herbs, a practice pursued by both Daoists and Buddhists, was a favorite scholarly pastime. It provided an excuse to interact with nature, which in itself could be a meditative process. The inscription reads:\r\n\r\n<I>During a spring day of the year 1612 of the Wanli reign, painted in the Chan (Buddhist) Grove at Vulture Peak by Xie Daoling of Wuchun (Suzhou).</I>",
