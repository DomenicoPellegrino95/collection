  "text": "Between 1918 and 1930 Matisse spent most of each year in Nice, during which time he evolved a more naturalistic style, concentrating on the female form, secluded interiors, and still-lifes saturated in light. His interest in this subject matter culminated in a series of paintings in 1924, among which Les Pensées de Pascal may be counted. Les Pensées is a collection of the spiritual writings, or thoughts (pensées) of Blaise Pascal (1623-1662), a 17th century French mathematician, physicist and later, Christian philosopher.",
