  "text": "An illuminated manuscript is a book written, illustrated, and decorated by hand. This Book of Hours appears modest in scale, but it is a truly extravagant object. Its 127 leaves are made from animal skins, and it contains 29 miniature paintings as well as extensive border decoration. Made in France, the book was intended for export and was customized for the religious practices of Rome. Though handwritten copies of utilitarian books rapidly disappeared after the invention of printing, luxury manuscripts coexisted with printed books for almost a century. ",
