  "text": "The unembellished curvilinear form of this silver teapot, with its simple wicker handle, highlights the expert craftsmanship of Karl Gustav Hansen. A prolific designer of hollow ware, flatware, and jewelry, he worked from 1940-1962 as artistic director of the Hansen firm, opened by his father Hans Hansen in 1906. Notable for his use of sculputral swelling lines as well as angular, geometric forms, in this teapot Hansen creates a flowing shape indicative of the amorphous liquid it is meant to hold.\r\n\r\n",
