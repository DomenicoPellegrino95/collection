  "text": "Lan Ying ranks among the top professional landscape painters of the late Ming era. He was born and trained in Hangzhou where the Zhe school had been centered during the early and middle Ming. While a technical mastery was realized early on, he varied somewhat from most professional painters in combining his technical proficiency with art historical knowledge of past painting styles. \r\nThe composition of this wintry landscape refers generally to the monumental landscape tradition of the Northern Song (960-1127). The larger forms are strongly silhouetted and the surface is one of light and dark contrasts. Lanâ€™s inscription indicates he did this painting in the manner of Wang Wei (699-759), a Tang dynasty master associated with the beginnings of the ink landscape tradition. Large seasonal paintings such as this were often hung above altar tables in the reception halls of the aristocracy.",
