  "text": "A superb technician with an encyclopedic knowledge of materials, Suzuki is capable of producing black and yellow Seto, Shino, and Oribe ware with clays and glazes astonishingly similar to historic examples. Recently, however, he has been producing non-functional, avant-garde shapes of great whimsy and charm. Here he created an expressively shaped teapot that he fired five times to achieve several layers of natural ash glaze. ",
