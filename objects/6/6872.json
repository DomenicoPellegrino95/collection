  "text": "During the 15th and 16th centuries, Japanese artists emulated Chinese ink landscape painting of the Southern Song dynasty (1127-1279), characterized by dramatic, asymmetrical compositions and decisive brushwork. Such landscapes became a stock theme for artists of the Kano school, official painters for Japan's military elite. Even after official diplomatic relations were severed with China in the seventeenth century, and Japanese were forbidden to travel abroad, Kano artists continued to produce ink landscapes in the traditional manner. These two hanging scrolls, with their exotic mountains, rushing waterways and wandering sages, appealed to the Japanese romantic concept of China.",
