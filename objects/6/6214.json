  "text": "Robert Arneson championed the Funk movement in ceramic sculpture which amused, offended, and often shocked with its humor and irreverence.  Arneson chose everyday objects for his subjects in clay, but unlike the clean, impersonal character of pop objects, Arneson's forms are rough, gestural and sarcastic.  Arneson's funk sculpture speaks to the tradition of mass-produced, commercial ceramics.  The brick, crafted by Arneson, is created to appear like a factory-produced brick.  Arneson's mocking of the tradition of ceramics as craft is reemphasized with the artist's signature \"ARNESON\" neatly stamped on the brick, replacing the name of a brick manufacturer.  In the humor of Arneson and funk ceramics, he has placed this seemingly ordinary brick out of context in a blob of sea-green fired clay and appropriately titled the piece <I>Brick at Sea<I>.  \u000b\u000b",
