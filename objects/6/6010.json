  "text": "The differences between the major cultures of the ancient Southwestern United States can be distinguished by the unique designs found on their ceramics. This bowl is an excellent example of what is called the Four Mile style. The black painted design in the center of this finely made ceramic depicts a stylized long-necked bird, perhaps a crane. The red and white step motif is a reference to sacred architecture and clouds.",
