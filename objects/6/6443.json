  "text": "Tibetans used portable shrines, or amulet containers, both at home on altars or fastened to cross-belts for traveling. The typical <I>gau<I> has a trefoil-shaped top and a central window showing the image of the owner's personal deity. The backs of such boxes are usually left plain, but the fronts are richly decorated. This <I>gau<I> is an exceptionally fine example of eastern Tibetan metalwork. It depicts dancing figures, each holding one of the symbols of the five senses (sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste) as a reminder that perceived reality is an illusion. These objects, portrayed in gold, contrast effectively with the deeply carved flowering vine in chased silver in the background.",
