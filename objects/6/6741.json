  "text": "In the Japanese collective psyche, Kawai Kanjiro_ ranks as highly as Hamada Sho_ji, but he is little known in the West since he refused all official honors (including designation as a \"Living National Treasure\") and never traveled to Europe or the United States. He established a studio and kiln in Kyoto and there created works that were as innovative for their sculptural shapes as for their masterful glazes. His slab-mold bottles, such as this example, are especially admired as they showcase his freely painted designs in cobalt blue, iron brown, and copper red. ",
