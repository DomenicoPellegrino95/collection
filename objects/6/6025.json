  "text": "Moroccan textiles and garments represent layers of aesthetic influences over the centuries, including Islamic, Jewish, Spanish, French, and Turkish. The elaborate gold cording and embroidery on this purple velvet caftan recall the influence of the Ottoman Empire in North Africa.\r\n\r\nMany specialists were involved in the making of this kind of luxury garment, worn at a formal court appearance or an elaborate social party - a designer for the decorative motifs, a maker of gold thread, an embroiderer, a craftsman for the metal buttons, and a tailor who would assemble the completed garment.
