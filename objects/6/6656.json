  "text": "From the late 12th century, the potters of Shigaraki produced a variety of sturdy, utilitarian wares designed to meet the needs of local farmers. The rough surface of Shigaraki ware, resulting from clay laden with quartz and feldspar, appealed to tea masters during the 17th century who adapted some pieces for use in the tea ceremony. This container is of the type traditionally used to soak hemp fibers. Fitted with a lacquered lid, it would have been used in the tea ceremony to hold fresh water. Tea aficionados humorously referred to this type of mizusashi as <I>oni oke<I> or \"demon pails.\"",
