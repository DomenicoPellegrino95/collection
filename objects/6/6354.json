  "text": "Both the Meissen and Plaue factories produced high-fired red stoneware during the early years of the eighteenth century. The factory at Plaue was founded by a former employee at the Meissen factory, Samuel Kempe, in 1713. Both factories produced similar forms with polished and cut decoration, and it is often extremely difficult to distinguish wares from the two factories.",
