  "text": "Li Shih-cho was born in Sanhan in the northern region of Jehol which was part of the Manchu homeland.  Although Chinese by birth, Li belonged to a unique group of Chinese enrolled in the Manchu military banner system. Of the fifty-four Chinese bannermen recorded as painters and calligraphers, most followed the orthodox tradition defined by the great literatus Tung Ch’i-ch’ang (1555-1636). While Li’s inscription cites the earlier masters Wu Chen (1289-1354) and Shen Chou (1427-1509) as his models, this painting is a direct reflection of Ni Tsan (1301-1374), one of the Four Great Masters of the fourteenth century. Li’s colophon reads:\r\n<BR>\r\n<P><I>People love Shih-t’ieng’s (Shen Chou) paintings and say that he succeeded to the hidden mysteries of Mei-tao-jen (Wu Chen). However, they don’t understand that, in reality, this was the family tradition which he received from his father Heng-chi (Shen Heng, 1409-1477). Yesterday, I passed by Kua-chou and, sitting at a rainy waterside window, brushed and dotted this picture which is conceptually between Wu and Shen.<I>\r\n<BR>\r\n<P><I>Li Shih-cho from San-han<I>\r\n",
