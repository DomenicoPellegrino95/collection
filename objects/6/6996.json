  "text": "A fountain seems an unusual decoration for a fire screen. But it became a favorite motif of designers in the 1920s, and allowed Brandt to show his skill in creating complex curving forms in the seemingly un-malleable material of iron. To achieve the fountain’s graceful curves and the swirling leaves and stems, Brandt used both traditional iron forging and newfound techniques like torch welding. ",
