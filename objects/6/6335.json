  "text": "Seth Eastman was an artist who served in the U.S. Army as a mapmaker and illustrator. He served twice at Fort Snelling, in what became the Minnesota Territory. Developing a deep interest in Native American life, he learned the Dakota language and created watercolors and drawings that present the astounding array of traditional Native life in Minnesota. With such variety and Eastman’s well-informed clarity of depiction, they constitute an unparalleled visual account of native ways in our region. This watercolor, Laughing Waters Three Miles Below the Falls of St. Anthony, is one of 35 works gifted to Mia by the W. Duncan and Nivin MacMillan Foundation.",
