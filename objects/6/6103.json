  "text": "Ely began making books as early as 1957. His interest in fine art, UFOs, alchemy, science fiction, comic books, and odd religious arcana is reflected in the design of many of his artist's books, including the one-of-a-kind volume Octagon 2. In this extraordinary example of his book work, Ely's enigmatic map-like diagrams and imaginary language evoke a sense of other-worldliness and serve as intellectual counterpoints to his visually compelling page designs.",
