  "text": "Jensen's evocative abstract imagery and his penchant for intaglio printmaking are fully realized in this artist's book that celebrates the memory of the Austrian Expressionist poet and author Georg Trakl (1887-1914). In collaboration with American poet John Yau, Jensen invokes the spirit of Trakl's modernist vision with a series of atmospheric compositions that use landscape as a nominal point of departure.",
