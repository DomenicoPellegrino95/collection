  "text": "The <I>kantharos<I> (plural, <I>kantharoi<I>), a type of drinking cup with two high loop handles and a deep bowl, is particularly associated with Dionysos, the Greek god of wine and vegetation. Its horizontal handles make this cup unusual, since they more closely resemble those of a shallower type of cup known as a <I>kylix<I>than those of other <I>kantharoi<I>. Since few ceramic examples of <I>kantharoi<I> survive, it is believed that they were more usually made of bronze, silver, or gold. Metal examples, often destroyed by corrosion or melted down for other uses, are also rare.",
