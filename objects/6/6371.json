  "text": "The sensitively modeled hands of this early Buddha image are in the symbolic gesture of discourse or argumentation in which the right hand is raised with thumb and index finger forming a circle. Termed <I>vitarka<I> mudra, this hand position recalls the Buddha's role as a sage and teacher. \r\n<I>After the fifth century, the Mon peoples migrated from Burma to Central Thailand where they adopted Buddhism. They developed a distinct image of the Buddha based on India prototypes of the Gupta period (5th-6th century) Sarnath school featuring a round face, elegant posture and smooth robes.\r\n<I>The physiognomies of mainland southeast Asian sculpture, however, are often drawn from local ethnic types. This is evident in this image with its slanting, rather than round eyes, full lips and broad forehead.",
