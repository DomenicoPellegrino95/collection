  "text": "A large image of the Buddha constituted the centerpiece of nearly all sculptural altar groupings within Buddhist temples. In terms of Buddhist hierarchy, it is the most important image. It is typically larger than accompanying statues and is positioned higher on the altar. This golden Buddha is seated cross-legged in meditation with eyes downcast and hands in lap. \r\n\nThe Buddha was an actual person rather than a god and, accordingly, such statues were not worshipped as deities. Rather, they were honored as symbols of enlightenment, human perfection, and Buddhist philosophy that pointed the worshipper toward a spiritual goal. Since the Buddha rejected materialism, he is typically shown with simple garments and no jewelry.",
