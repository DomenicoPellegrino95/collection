  "text": "Chocolate pots were frequently used in the early 19th century when chocolate was at its height of popularity. Due to rather primitive refining processes it had to be stirred continously so the rich sediment wouldn't settle. The small hole and sliding cover in the lid accommodated a stirrer (spun between both hands). It was exhibited at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris, but despite what appears to be a worn ivory handle (then considered to be an aesthetic enhancement) the work has never been used.",
