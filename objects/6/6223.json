  "text": "In a former time, Ardhanarisvara (the Lord Whose Half is Woman) divided himself into the Great God and the Great Goddess called Devi. Devi was born as the daughter of the King of the Mountain and became known as Parvati or Uma. She attracted Shiva, the Great Ascetic, with her incomparable beauty and won him as her husband by impressing him with her devout asceticism.\r\n<P>The Chola artisans of South India (Tamil Nadu) gave classic form to the Great Goddess subject in their highly accomplished bronze sculpture. Parvati is shown here in an idealized state of womanhood, her voluptuous body that gives and nourishes life displays an exaggerated sensuousness that radiates the physical and spiritual perfection of the great mother goddess, insurer of female fertility. Parvati is also worshipped as a mountain goddess, the consort of Shiva, and a symbol of the earth's fecundity and regenerative energy.",
