  "text": "Buncheong ware is a form of Korean stoneware with green-bluish glaze that was popular in the 15th century. This bottle is an example of sgraffito design where potters first brushed the surface with white slip and after it dried to a leather-like hardness, they incised the design with fine lines and certain areas were carved away. In this manner, the decorative motif in white—in this case a scrolling peony leaf design—stands out dramatically against the darker clay. At the end, a thin glaze was applied.",
