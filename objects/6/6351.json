  "text": "Kotah is a large jungle state in southeast Rajasthan that began to produce court paintings in the early eighteenth century. Influenced at first by the complex painting style of the neighboring Bundi court, Kotah artists simplified their pictorial forms during the reign of Raja Umed Singh (1771-1819). As in this brilliantly colored portrait, select elements are shown in magnified detail, while larger forms exhibit a naive, dreamlike simplicity. The rather stiff profile pose, floral inner border, and halo are adapted from the standard portraiture of the Muslim sultans of the early seventeenth century. A native penchant for decorative colors and flattened compositions, characteristic of most Rajput painting, is also evident.",
