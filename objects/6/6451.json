  "text": "This weathervane was made for the cupola of the Winslow House, a luxury hotel erected around 1857 on the east bank of St. Anthony Falls.  Recent scholarship suggests this vane may have been made in France and purchased while on display at the 1853 World's Exposition in New York.  Here the graceful archangel Gabriel carries a trumpet and an olive branch, signifying his roles as a herald and a bringer of peace.  Gabriel is also known as the angel of the north wind, and thus an appropriate choice for a weathervane.",
