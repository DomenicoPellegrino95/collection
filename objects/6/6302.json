  "text": "This painting is signed on the reverse by the artist, Sheldon Peck, and the birthdate of the unidentified child appears on the front: \"Born Aug. the 21 1828\". The painting descended in the family of the lender, whose great-great-grandmother Lucy Pratt was born in Sanstead Plains, New York, the daughter of an itinerant preacher who traveled from New York to Vermont. Apparently, the Pratt family migrated to Whitewater, Wisconsin, and there Lucy married Stacey Shortt of Vermont. The couple moved to Sioux City, Iowa, and shortly after her husband's death from wounds received during the Civil War, Lucy remarried and moved to Minneapolis.\r\n\nBorn in Cornwall, Vermont, Sheldon Peck traveled throughout Vermont and western New York painting single and family-group portraits. In 1838, he settled in Lombard, Illinois.",
