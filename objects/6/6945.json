  "text": "The French artist-designer, Jacques Le Chevallier was among the foremost lighting designers of the '20s and '30s. Utilitarian to a fault, his lamps are brazenly functional: elements of machinery, composed of inelegant, erector-set metal fragments held together by unconcealed screws. Understandably, few ever gained wide acceptance. Consequently, their production was limited, sometimes to only a prototype, which accounts for their rarity.",
