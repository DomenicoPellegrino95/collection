  "text": "Owing much to the statuary Gupta period India, this image wears a pleated monastic robe which leaves the right shoulder bare. The end of the drapery is thrown over the shoulder and folds down the back, making a pleat.\r\n<P>Bronze images of the Buddha cast in the sculptural tradition of Amaravati (Andra Pradish, India) have been found in many places in Southeast Asia such as Dong Duong (Vietnam), Pong Tuk (Thailand) and Sulawesi and Java in Indonesia. A distinctive feature of the Amaravati style is the linear treatment of the drapery folds and aquiline nose. This statue also shows the large hands associated with the Mon-Dvaravati style of Peninsular Thailand. Bronze Buddhas of the Amaravati type were used for missionary purposes in Southeast Asia during the spread of the religion from India and Sri Lanka along the trade routes.",
