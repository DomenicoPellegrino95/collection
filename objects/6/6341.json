  "text": "One of the most distinct sculptural types developed by the ancient Cambodians is the guardian lion. Considered protectors of the Buddhist teachings, pairs of lion images were often placed flanking temple doors and monumental stairways. Their sculpted remnants are still evident in several of the temple remains at Angkor as well as ancient Khmer sites in Thailand like Lopburi.\r\n<P> Lions were not native to Cambodia and, from the beginning, Khmer artists depicted them as rather fantastic stylized beasts. The lion here is of the Bayon style, with its mouth wide open and lips drawn back like a grin. The massive chest is covered by a decorative mane and the posture is rigid befitting a temple guardian.",
