  "text": "From a young age, Charles M. Russell sculpted small figures of animals out of wax supplied to him by his father. Cast in bronze, <I>The Bucker and Buckeroo</I> represents a later work in Russell's artistic career. Russell's adventure in Montana and close observation of animals, aided by photography, inspired him to create this sculptural work, which naturalistically captures a horse attempting to unseat its rider. The horse's twisted \"sunfisher\" pose puts the balance solely on the front right leg and the right side of the horse's face, while the hind legs have sprung off the ground in an attempt to buck the \"buckaroo,\" whose torso bends to the left with his right arm raised upwards grasping his hat in hand. The delicate balance of the horse and man, along with the horse's exasperated, open-mouthed expression emphasize the tumultuous nature of life in the American West during the late nineteenth century.",
