  "text": "Born in Germany, Bellmer was initially attracted to the work of George Grosz and the Berlin Dadaists, but after relocating to Paris, he became involved with the Surrealist movement. In 1933 he began a series of works now known as <I>The Doll (La Poup√©e).<I> To a certain degree, these images - photographs, drawings, and paintings - illustrated the various permutations the artist derived from the manipulation of jointed wood dolls. <I>Untitled<I>, however, also shows how Bellmer pushed beyond simple representation. Believing that a true understanding of the human body could only be achieved through its deconstruction, he has displaced and repeated various body parts to achieve imaginative reconstructions of the human anatomy.",
