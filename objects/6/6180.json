  "text": "This house, often referred to as the \"airplane house,\" was one of three houses built for Charles R. Crane, originally a client of Louis Sullivan. Situated on a peninsula with later service buildings also by Purcell and Elmslie, the house needed to be completed between June and September of 1912. Purcell and Elmslie's Edward W. Decker house in Wayzata (1914) was built with a similarly dramatic plan. A chair from the Decker house is on view in this gallery.",
