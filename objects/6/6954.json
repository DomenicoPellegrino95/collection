  "text": "Kem Weber was not perhaps a household name, but he was responsible for bringing the modern style in industrial design to the West Coast.  Having come from Germany to work on the 1915 San Francisco Panama Pacific International Exposition, he was trapped in the U.S. after the outbreak of the First World War and denied permission to return at war's end.  Making lemonade from these lemons, he became a well-known designer in California, especially with the Hollywood set, with his most famous design being the \"Airline\" chair produced for Walt Disney Studios in the mid-1930s. \r\n\r\nWeber produced several digital clocks for Lawson Time in Pasadena, but \"The Zephyr\" is the most inventive and memorable, in the new digital format.  Inspired by the Burlington Pioneer Zephyr train which sped between Chicago and Denver (once clocked in a test run at 104 m.p.h.), the clock is rather ingenious in form, a graceful inverted \"S\"-shaped contour.",
