  "text": "Leaf-shaped pillows were an innovation of the Tz'u-chou kilns and those with sgraffito decoration on black slip over white slip like this one were popular from the late eleventh through the twelfth century. This handsome example displays a boldly incised peony spray symbolizing wealth, spring, and feminine beauty. The peony was a common motif during this period and one that archaeologists have shown was manufactured largely at northern kilns in the Kuan-t'ai area, near the former Tz'u-chou in southern Hopei Province. Tz'u-chou ware developed entirely as a popular, inexpensive stoneware tradition for everyday use. The rough clay bodies were given a smooth white surface by the application of a white slip upon which the potters explored a great variety of decorative techniques",
