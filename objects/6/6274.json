Purcell house, designed for architect Purcell and his family, to have a sense of humor, hence the whimsical name of the chair and other related elements, such as the \"Peek-A-Boo\" leaded glass windows flanking the entry of the house.\r\n\r\n[insert historic photo of Purcell-Cutts living room here - this is new addition - photo from NWAA]",
