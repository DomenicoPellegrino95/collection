  "text": "After a brief apprenticeship with Achille-Etna Michallon, Corot embarked on the first and longest of his three visits to Italy in November 1825. Working mostly in Rome and its environs, he adhered to the academic practice of sketching in oils constantly from the motif. He would return to Paris in the summer 1828 with several hundred oil studies and a fully mature style.",
