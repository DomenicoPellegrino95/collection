  "text": "Corot was in his early twenties before his parents allowed him to pursue art studies with Achille Etna Michallon, a proponent of the ideal and historical landscape tradition. However, it was an encounter with the landscape watercolors of Richard Parkes Bonington that Corot decided to become a naturalistic landscape painter. In pursuit of his dream, he embarked on the first of three visits to Italy in November 1825. Working mostly in Rome and its environs, Corot adhered to the French practice of sketching in oils constantly from the motif. \r\n \r\nThis scene is the Vatican complex as seen from Monte Pincio, or the Pincian Hill, of Rome. It looks very different that the actual view because Corot decided only to sketch in the buildings of St. Peter and not the surrounding cityscape of Rome; instead, he painted trees and grasslands to fill in the scene, though hints of the avenues remain.",
