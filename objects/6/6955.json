  "text": "Designed by Böres as a commission for a special occasion, likely a ceremonial function, this presention cup (pokal) is more an objet de vertu than a functional piece. Having begun as a jewelry designer, he continued to produce small scale metalwork complemented with intricate detail. The cup's surface is delicately hammered and the stem's rhythmic floral motif offers an arabesque counterpoint. The amethyst setting provides a quiet punctuation to the overall design.",
