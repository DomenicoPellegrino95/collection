  "text": "須恵器 Sueki stoneware\r\n\r\nThis type of vessel is known as a “recumbent vessel,” or <I>yokobe<I>. Its asymmetrical body indicates it was meant to be placed on its side—it was probably intended for storing sake (rice wine). Natural ash glaze, pooled on its surface, creates a pleasing mottled effect on its shoulders and a pattern of drips along a portion of the jar’s irregular, bulging body.",
