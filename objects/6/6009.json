  "text": "Bottles and flasks with a thick iron-brown or black glaze became popular during the Choson period. Because shards of such vessels have been found at Punch'ong kilns, it is likely that the same kilns produced both wares. This vessel with its unctuous glaze and cascade effect, is particularly pleasing.",
