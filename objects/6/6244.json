  "text": "Elise Weyerhaeuser purchased this tall case clock in 1904 as a seventieth birthday present for her husband, Frederick, when they lived at 266 Summit Avenue in St. Paul. It was a surprise gift, which she found at Tiffany & Co. in New York, one of the most important firms for decorative objects in America. The elaborate clock case has fantastic mythological and nautical motifs from top to bottom: winged-dragons at the top, carvings of \"Father Time\" next to the clock face, female caryatids that resemble ship figureheads near the chimes, and at the bottom, seated griffins flanking a ship at sea. Though it was made in the early 1900s, its older, Renaissance revival style, with heavy carved figures, scrolls, and foliage, would have appealed to a man like Mr. Weyerhauser whose tastes were formed in the 1800s. \r\n",
