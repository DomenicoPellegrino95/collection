  "text": "Philosophical Taoism had a profound effect on the development of Chinese nature poetry and landscape painting. The ideal state of harmony between man and nature is often a subtext in landscape painting usually making the individual a minor element within a calm and inspiring natural setting.\r\n<P>The colophon accompanying this view of a scholar relaxing his feet in a mountain stream reads:\r\n\r\n<P><I>In deep seclusion the eastern wind blows fallen blossoms,<I>\r\n<P><I>The whole river of spring water ripples with cloudy mist;<I>\r\n<P><I>The wanderer's song has ceased and he is entirely at leisure,<I>\r\n<P><I>Resting by an old valley pine while the sun has not yet set.<I>\r\n\r\n<P><I>Hsieh Shih-ch'en<I>",
