  "text": "This portrait head is thought to have come from Hauran, near Palmyra, in southern Syria. The Hauran was an oasis kingdom located at the edge of the Eastern Roman Empire. This volcanic region, one of the most fertile in Syria, was particularly famous for its vineyards. The prosperous cities of the Hauran had developed their own indigenous culture before being absorbed into the Roman Empire.\r\n<P>Encouraged by the local availability of limestone, sculptors in nearby Palmyra produced numerous homogeneous and highly original sculptures, most of which date from the 1st-3rd centuries A.D. This head shows affinities with Palmyrene funerary sculpture, in which the heads are invariably shown frontally, eyes are prominent, and facial features are symmetrical.\r\n",
