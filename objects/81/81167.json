  "text": "This curious portrait head depicts a mature man with thick, deeply undercut hair and a short beard. The volume of hair is so pronounced that the face becomes a flat plane beneath it, with no real transitions from the forehead and brow to the cheeks and chin. All of these factors suggest that the head has been recarved into a new portrait image.\r\n<P>The demand for marble portraits was so great in ancient Rome that recut portraits were common. In the late empire, in addition to the patrician class, many freed slaves acquired the right, and had the means, to commission portraits for their tombs. Marble was costly, and there was no reason to destroy a statue when one could merely replace or recarve the head. Discarded statues, or their heads, would be warehoused for future use, often for some time, so that a statue and its new head were stylistically inconsistent.\r\n",
