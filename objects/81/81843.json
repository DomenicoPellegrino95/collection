  "text": "Like many contemporary Japanese ceramists, Tsujimura Shiro_ produces pottery in a variety of historic styles. For this tea bowl, the simple bowls first imported from Korea in the sixteenth-century inspired him. Because of their generous proportions, the Japanese dubbed these bowls \"ido\" or \"deep well,\" and they became popular for use in the tea ceremony. Typically, the potter covered the rough clay body with a light-colored slip before applying a transparent ash glaze. Pieces of sand in the clay broke through the slip in the intense heat of the kiln, creating the modeled coloration and appealing texture that characterizes this bowl.",
