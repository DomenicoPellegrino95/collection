  "text": "The god Serapis became popular in Egypt in the 4th century B.C. The Ptolemaic rulers of Egypt, beginning with Ptolemy I in 323 B.C., actively promoted the cult of Serapis, who was revered throughout the Mediterranean world as the sun god, the god of both fertility and healing. In Alexandria, a temple was dedicated to him, known as the Serapium, where the god was represented as a seated, bearded figure with a three-headed dog at his left hand. In the international context of the Roman Empire, the worship of the supreme Greek god Zeus was sometimes fused with that of important gods in other cults, Serapis among them. The cult of Serapis was exceptionally popular with the Roman military. The emperor Septimius Severus (119-211 A.D.) had his portraits modeled on the god's image.\r\n<P>The droopy mustache, parted beard, and set of the mouth (with a slightly overhanging upper lip) are ultimately derived from the cult statue in the Serapium of Alexandria. The fragment of a throne on the back of the piece indicates that it was originally part of a life-sized, seated statue. A plain diadem encircles the head.\r\n",
