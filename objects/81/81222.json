  "text": "In antique art there were representations of both the wise, sober Silenus and the drunken one. Silenus was outstanding among his fellow <I>silenoi<I> for his wisdom, which he may have inherited from the union of his mother, a nymph, with one of the divinities (Hermes or Pan).\r\n<P>Seated on a fragmentary wineskin, wearing an ivy wreath in his hair and a panther skin draped on his left shoulder, this Silenus appears to be dozing after a round of Dionysian revelry. The grape wreath in his curly hair confirms that his current state is more the result of his actions than of his age.",
