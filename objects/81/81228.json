  "text": "In the legends of ancient Asia Minor, Silenus was a divinity of the woodlands and fountains. If captured by mortals, he would sing and prophesy. In later legends, he became the teacher and trainer of the wine-god Dionysus, and is thought to have instructed the young god in the cultivation of vines and bee keeping.\r\n<P>Silenus is usually portrayed as a plump, jovial man, bald, but with a long beard and a horse's tail. In this example there is the remnant of a wreath on his head. A figure in this pose, supporting its weight with its left leg, usually requires an additional support to make visual sense, often a tiny, youthful satyr. The image of a standing Silenus became popular in the 2nd century B.C., both as small terracotta statues and large-scale works for outdoor settings.\r\n",
