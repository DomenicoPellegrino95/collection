  "text": "Several portraits of this woman are known, suggesting that she was a minor member of the imperial elite. Her distinctive hairstyle dates to the early years of the Antonine period (c. 138 A.D.). Female portraiture of this era combines elaborate hairstyles with delicately carved and modeled faces.\r\n<P>Portraits of Faustina the Younger, the wife of the emperor Marcus Aurelius, of about 147 A.D., show her wearing a similar coiffeur, with the hair parted in the middle and sectioned in waves, culminating in a circular shaped bun on the back of the head. The faces of these portraits are smooth and youthful, presenting the young empress as the Augustan ideal of womanhood.\r\n",
