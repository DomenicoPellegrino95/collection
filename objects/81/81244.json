  "text": "The tall, tiara-like hairstyle of this female portrait was fashionable among aristocratic women in Rome in the early 2nd century A.D. Richly carved foliage fills the area between the woman's head and the remnant of a slanting gable of the tomb structure.\r\n<P>Oak and acorn decoration played an important role in Roman culture. Oak was the tree sacred to Jupiter. A wreath of oak, the <I>corona civica<I>, was awarded for saving a comrade in battle. When worn by the emperor, it denoted his role in \"saving\" the state and was loosely regarded as a sign of triumph. Setting an individual's portrait in a niche or gable was the equivalent of honoring him or her with an image on a shield, or <I>clippius<I>. The woman in this relief is twice honored because the oak of immortality takes the form of a pediment. It signifies her triumph and alludes to the area of temple architecture that carried images of the gods.\r\n",
