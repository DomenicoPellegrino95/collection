  "text": "The somber expression on this portrait's face suggests a contemplative mood. By the 3rd century A.D., the Roman Empire was in decline due to many adverse internal and external factors. Even though Rome had long been a great cosmopolitan city, its citizens looked back to moral qualities revered during the Republican period, when citizens were patriotic farmer-soldiers. The moral quality most valued by the Romans was <I>virtus<I>, literally, \"manliness,\" but it carried the special sense of bravery in battle. <I>Virtus<I> stressed strength, toughness, simplicity, and bearing-up under adversity. Ultimately, the term came to suggest the character of moral goodness as a whole, close to the broader meaning of the modern word \"virtue.\"",
