  "text": "After Rome endured many years of civil wars, Augustus assumed complete power in 27 B.C. He claimed that he was reestablishing the Roman Republic, but in reality he founded the Roman Empire. Augustus commissioned public sculpture and monumental architecture to help emphasize the power and legitimacy of his new political order.\r\n<P>The course of Roman portraiture was radically altered by artists creating highly idealized, official portraits of the emperor Augustus. These portraits were intended more as political statements than likenesses, for they embodied the promise of the new empire in the perfect visage of its princeps, or first citizen. Portraits of Augustus always convey a sense of mastery and the perpetuation of youth through the controlled beauty of the Classical ideal. One constant feature of portraits of Augustus is the hairstyle, which falls in overlapping segments and breaks into carefully positioned strands of hair on his forehead.\r\n",
