  "text": "The subject of this portrait has been identified as Manlia Scantilla, the wife of Didius Julianus, who reigned as emperor for sixty-one days, from March to June of 193 A.D. Despite the unrest and uncertainty of the times, the Roman Senate granted Manlia Scantilla the honorific title of <I>Augusta<I>, and a few issues of coins were struck with her portrait. The images on coins show an older woman in profile, but with similar wavy hair falling from a center part and caught up with a large bun on the back of the head. \r\n<P>Remnants of gesso (plaster) on the top of the head suggest that the hair was once built up from the extant marble cap and painted. Separate pieces of marble were used to form the sides and rear of the large, flat bun. The fact that the bun does not exactly fit the head indicates that it, like the gesso on the front, was part of a reworking of the head to give it a more contemporary appearance.\r\n",
