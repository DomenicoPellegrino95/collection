  "text": "The emperor Diocletian was born in Dalmatia of slave parents. He entered the army and rose through the ranks because of his superior abilities. His fellow soldiers proclaimed him emperor in 284 A.D. Diocletian attempted to reorganize the vast empire into four administrative districts, each controlled by a supreme governor, or <I>tetrarch<I>. This four-ruler system was called the <I>tetrarchia<I>. This form of provincial rule essentially remained in force for many years, and Diocletian's socio-economic legislation had far-reaching consequences in the ancient world. Diocletian also tried to reintroduce the pagan religion by assuming the title <I>Jovius<I> (in homage to Jupiter), and by starting new persecutions against the Christians, whom he regarded as a disruptive element. \r\n<P>This head wears a heavy oak wreath, a form of commemoration used in Roman imperial portraiture. Here, it may also allude to Diocletian's association with Jupiter.\r\n",
