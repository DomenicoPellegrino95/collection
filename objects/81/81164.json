  "text": "Zeus, the supreme god of the universe in Greek mythology, was identified with the Roman god, Jupiter. Zeus was traditionally depicted as a powerful, bearded figure. Here, a massive beard and a hairstyle with a tall upsweep, or <I>anastole<I>, encircle the god's broad face, granting him a mature, but not aged appearance.\r\n<P>The corkscrew curls in the hair and beard were created by deeply drilled channels that break up the surface of the mass, a characteristic technique of Roman art during the late 2nd century A.D.\r\n",
