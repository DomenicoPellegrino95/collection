  "text": "This is a section of the decoration of a Roman sarcophagus (a stone coffin). Wealthy Romans who hoped to avoid the oblivion of death created a thriving demand for sarcophagi. They were often roughly carved out near the quarry site and then shipped to metropolitan centers, where they were finished by local sculptors. Since the sides and lid of a sarcophagus were often ornamented with carvings, a wide variety of funerary imagery was developed.\r\n<P>This fragment depicts a standard composition for a Roman sarcophagus of the 2nd century A.D. At the left a tiny nude figure supports a heavy garland of oak leaves. The large leaf at the center of the garland must have held a pendant bunch of grapes. The large, flamboyantly carved head of a gorgon has the full face, heavy brows, parted lips, and wild hair of the \"pathetic\" style gorgon. The monster's close curls are a metaphor for the writhing snakes that characterize a gorgon in early Greek mythology.\r\n",
