  "text": "Commodus, the son of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius and Faustina Minor, was born in 161 A.D. From 175 A.D. on, Commodus accompanied his father on provincial journeys and, in 177 A.D., was made co-ruler. Upon his father's death in 180 A.D., Commodus became sole ruler. Although there was great expectation among the Roman citizens that his reign would open a new era of peace and fiscal renewal, Commodus governed in a despotic fashion and promoted notions of his own divinity, which he demonstrated costumed as the god Hercules in the streets and in the arena, where he fought as a gladiator. After his assassination in 192 A.D., the Senate condemned him to <I>damnatio memoriae<I>. This meant that all mention of him was prohibited, all his images destroyed, and his name erased from all monuments and public records. \r\n<P>Commodus here wears a <I>corona triumphalis<I>, honoring him as a triumphant conqueror, a wreath only emperors were entitled to wear. This portrait head is thought to have been made in Athens for insertion in a full statue.\r\n",
