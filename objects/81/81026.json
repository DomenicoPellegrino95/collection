  "text": "As Japan rapidly modernized during the Meiji period (1868-1912), people became nostalgic for the past. Catering to this interest, artists created prints that featured subjects from the country's feudal times. In 1896, Kiyochika designed a series featuring women from different eras within the Edo period (1603-1868). For this print, he depicted a beauty with a large chignon and boldly patterned kimono-styles prevalent in the Kan'ei (1624-44) and Shøhø (1644-48) eras.  Kiyochika even rendered the details of her physiognomy in a manner reminiscent of those by the 18th century artists. The silhouettes of boats in the distance suggest that this beauty, too, is in a boat and enjoying an evening river cruise, a favorite summer pastime in the Edo period.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
