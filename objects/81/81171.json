  "text": "This portrait bust was carved for insertion into a statue. Until late antiquity, full-length statues of figures wearing togas or breastplate armor remained the noblest forms of portraiture and served to perpetuate the fame of the subject for future generations as in a kind of civic immortality.\r\n<P>The sensitive portrayal of this face recalls works created during the Antonine dynasty of emperors (138-192 A.D.). During this period artists adopted a style that explored the psychological states of their subjects and exploited the effects of light and shadow by drilling deeply into the block. The mature and contemplative facial expression was meant to indicate experience, effort, and achievement.\r\n",
