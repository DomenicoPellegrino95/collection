  "text": "This is a fragment of a capital, the crowning feature of a column that usually serves as a transition between the shaft of the column and the architectural element it supports. Since ancient times, it has been customary to finish stone capitals with carved decorations.\r\n<P>This capital is dominated by two heads: a gorgon (with wings springing from her forehead and snakes tied around her neck) and the goddess Tyche (wearing the remnant of a walled crown). The two figures are unified symbolically as well, because both the gorgon and Tyche were emblems of protection in Greek and Roman art. The gorgon, a hideously ugly, mythological creature of great antiquity, was placed on temples, armor, and even jewelry as an <I>apotropaion<I>, a protective device that was thought to drive away evil.\r\n<P>Tyche, the goddess of good fortune, was invoked by individuals for personal favors. However, when she wears the walled crown she represents the personification of the city, ensuring it and its inhabitants prosperity and well-being.\r\n",
