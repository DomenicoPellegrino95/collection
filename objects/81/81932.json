  "text": "Men in Chichicastenango no longer wear <I>traje<I> as everyday clothing, but their ceremonial <I>traje<I> is among the most spectacular in the Guatemala highlands. Loosely patterned after a Spanish matador's costume, the heavy woolen jacket and pants are opulently embroidered in silk or sedalina (synthetic silk) floss. One large red tzute is carefully arranged as a head covering, while additional tzutes may be worn over the shoulders or used to carry ritual objects or candles.\r\n\tThe side flaps on the pants exhibit the traditional sunburst design and are said to be embroidered by the owner. The size and intricacy of this motif indicates the man's relative standing within the community. Young men have rather small designs, reflecting their youth and inexperience; as they grow and mature they embroider larger, more elaborate embellishments.\r\n",
