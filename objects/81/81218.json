  "text": "Asklepius was originally a mortal physician who became the god of medicine in Greek mythology. His cult was widely popular in Roman times because it offered practical solutions for the curing of sickness and the promotion of good health. His most famous shrine was at Epidaurus, a Greek city in eastern Peloponnese. The usual method of healing practiced there began with the sick person sleeping in the temple. The god would appear to him in a dream and indicate the method of treatment, which included baths, gymnastics, and special diets. Many votive offerings left by worshippers who were cured have been found at the temple site.\r\n<P>Complete statues of Asklepius usually depict him standing, partially draped, and holding a snake-entwined staff. This head is a Roman work of the 2nd century A.D., based on a much earlier Greek original.\r\n",
