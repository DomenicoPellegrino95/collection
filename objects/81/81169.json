  "text": "Faustina Minor, the daughter of Antoninus Pius and Faustina Major, was born Annia Galeria between 125 and 130 A.D. She married Marcus Aurelius in 145 A.D. and was the mother of the emperor Commodus, the ninth of her thirteen children.\r\n<P>A Roman empress was regarded as the role model of the dutiful Roman matron. The ideal Roman woman was expected to possess such virtues as beauty, faithfulness to her husband, fertility, and an outstanding ability to run the household. Faustina, who was designated with the honorific title of <I>Augusta<I> after the birth of her first child, was honored with idealized portraits that link her to the goddesses of marriage, fertility, and family. The headband of this figure is drilled with holes that originally held a crown of rosettes and ears of grain. When portrayed wearing this <I>corona spicea<I>, the empress took on the qualities of Ceres, the goddess of grain.",
