  "text": "Roman portraits were honorific, commemorative, and, unlike idealized Greek portraits, often highly realistic. This honest appraisal of an older man was intended to be a true likeness of the subject. It is an example of private Roman portrait sculpture, which was most closely associated with funerary contexts. Portrait reliefs adorned sarcophagi, and portrait busts accompanied cinerary urns that were deposited in niches in large communal tombs. The rise of portrait sculpture was rooted in the longstanding Roman tradition of wax portrait masks. These masks, often of distinguished ancestors, were carried in funeral processions and displayed in a special shrine in the family's home.\r\n",
