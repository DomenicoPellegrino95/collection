  "text": "The aged face, long beard, and flat, shaggy hair suggest that this portrait head belongs to a specific sculptural type in Roman art, the philosopher portrait. These figures were used to decorate public libraries and private residences as symbols of refinement, thereby elevating the status of their owners by association.\r\n<P>This portrait has been associated with representations of the Greek philosopher Antisthenes (450-375 B.C.), founder of the Cynic movement. He believed that man's happiness lay in cultivating virtue for its own sake. To attain virtue, man must reduce his dependence on the external world to a minimum, ignore social conventions, and live in poverty \"according to nature.\"  The tousled hair and straggly beard of this portrait conform to the unkempt appearance in traditional representations of Antisthenes.\r\n",
