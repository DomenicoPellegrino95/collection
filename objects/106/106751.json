  "text": "Among the second generation of studio craftsmen working in wood, William Hunter has been a significant player in liberating the turned wood vessel from its functional role and taking wood craftsmanship to new heights.  A full-time wood turner since the 1970s, Hunter favors exotic, densely grained hardwood which requires skill, strength, and control to manipulate.  Though he is most recognized for his carved and turned cocobolo vessels, in <I>Legends of the New World</I>, Hunter eschews carving in favor of exploiting the dramatic grain patterns of a single piece of granadillo burl, a full revelation of the \"beauty contained within the wood\" so admired by collectors Dan Greenberg and Susan Steinhauser, who gave this piece to the MIA.",
