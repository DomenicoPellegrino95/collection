  "text": "English explorers first described women's Micmac hoods of this type in the 17th century, yet few have survived because they were made of fragile materials.  Decorative silk ribbons, highlighted with white beads, can be found along the edging and down the center of the hood.  The exact meaning of the double-curved motif that decorates the surface of the hood is not certain; it may be a protective element, or refer to flowers or vines.",
