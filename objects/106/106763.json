  "text": "Marsh's first exposure to wood turning occurred at the age of fourteen, when he was a cabinetmaker's apprentice.  He was fascinated by the turning process, but did not try it himself until years later, after a heart attack caused him to reassess his life and give up teaching for studio art.  Marsh, who recently passed away, did not ascribe a deep or profound meaning to his work; he simply loved the material and strove to perfect his forms. He and fellow English turner Ray Key, whose work is also in this case, were close friends and shared the same aesthetic.",
