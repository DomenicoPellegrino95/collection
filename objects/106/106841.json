  "text": "Henry van de Velde was a leading avant garde designer in the Art Nouveau movement in France, and its German counterpart, Jungendstil.  This game table, a rare example of the type, exhibits the strong curvilinear elements so important in botanically inspired Art Nouveau designs. Van de Velde's characteristically strong and confident lines animate the form, while providing a sturdy and compact table for gaming.  Other beautiful and practical solutions are the small shelves to contain counters or drinks, and the table top, whose four triangular sections fold out to a larger, leather-covered rectangular surface when in use.
