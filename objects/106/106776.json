  "text": "Sakwa attended Hershey Industrial School and the University of Maryland, where he began his artistic career by making objects from leather.  Sakwa returned to his native Los Angeles in 1972 and took up wood turning.  In this piece, Sakwa emphasizes the material by displaying the wood's grain and natural edge.  Today, Sakwa works in the field of commercial photography, often photographing the work of other woodturners.",
