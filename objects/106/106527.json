  "text": "Among all the artists who rushed to document the trans-Mississippi West, Seth Eastman remains the foremost interpreter of the Minnesota Territory.   Trained in drawing at West Point Military Academy, Eastman first came to Fort Snelling in 1829 and, following a hiatus at West Point as a drawing instructor, returned in 1841 as a commissioned officer for a seven-year stay. \r\n\r\n<I>The Falls of St. Anthony</I> was executed in the final year of Eastman's second posting at Fort Snelling and shows the falls and the surrounding banks relatively untouched by the commercial development that would follow in the wake of Euro-American settlement.  The only hint of the coming incursion is in the middle distance where the first dam ever built above the falls connects the east bank of the Mississippi to the east bank of Nicollet Island. (The dam was built by Franklin Steele in 1848.) ",
