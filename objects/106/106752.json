  "text": "Hunter carved Dalbergia Grass from a single piece of densely-grained cocobolo wood. He created a contemporary vase, with the same exuberance as the 18th-century Chelsea vase nearby, through his own skill, strength, and control first in turning, then in carving, a single piece of wood. The grasslike carvings complement the tall vertical form. It is one of a series of works Hunter developed that are named after the genus of the cocobolo tree, Dalbergia. \r\n.",
