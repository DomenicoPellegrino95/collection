  "text": "Among the second generation of studio craftsmen working in wood, William Hunter has been a significant player in liberating the turned wood vessel from its functional role and taking wood craftsmanship to new heights.  A full-time wood turner since the 1970s, Hunter favors exotic, densely grained hardwood which requires skill, strength, and control to manipulate.  \r\n\r\nHunter's <I>Dalbergia Grass<I> is a large and lovely example of the artist's skillful carving of natural motifs--here grasslike elements--to complement the tall vertical form.  Hunter developed a series of works named after the genus of the cocobolo tree, <I>Dalbergia<I>.",
