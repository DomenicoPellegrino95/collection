  "text": "Helena Hernmarck works in the traditional art of tapestry weaving, though she has developed her own unconventional pictorial approach. Born in Sweden, she received a traditional education in Swedish textile production at the Handarbetets Vanner and the Konstfackskolan Art School in Stockholm. In 1964 she moved to Montreal, where she began developing her unique approach to imagery. She prefers to call it \"superrealism,\" a style that she says stretches \"from the ridiculous to the sublime.\" She takes a photo of something ordinary and interprets it in an unexpected dimension, most often using tremendous magnification, in order to jolt the viewer into a new frame of reference. <I>Four Tulips</I> displays her exceptional handling of color in weaving; she achieves an incredible range of tonalities and shading that emphasizes the realism of her imagery. Her works are most often commissioned for use in large public architectural spaces.",
