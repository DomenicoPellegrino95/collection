  "text": "Like fellow artists Gianfranco Angelino and Virginia Dotson, whose work is also seen here, Shuler does not begin with a solid piece of wood, but constructs a block from individual pieces--here exotic hardwoods--and turns the resulting laminate piece to an amazing thinnness.  Shuler does not use any stains or dyes; he relies on the colors and patterns of the wood to create a striking mosaic.  ",
