  "text": "This cow weathervane was made by one of the most prominent American weathervane manufacturers, Cushing & White.  The finely muscled, three-dimensional copper body and the delicate features of the zinc head are the result of the finely crafted molds and the hand-hammered technique for which Cushing and White was known.  Originally gilded, the sheet copper body has weathered to a warm green patina, leaving only a shadow of the gilding squares. \r\n\r\n",
