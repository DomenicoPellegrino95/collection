  "text": "Ron Kent prefers to work with the unusual grain patterns of Norfolk Island pine, which is local to his home of Hawaii.  While traditional woodworkers dry the wood before turning it, Kent turns his pine when it is \"wet\" or \"green.\"  To stabilize the often paper-thin forms and give them the translucency his work is best known for, he then soaks them in vats of oil.",
