  "text": "A respected literatus living in Suchou during late Ch'ing, Ku Yun was sent as an envoy to Japan in 1887. His painting generally followed in the manner of the Ch'ing Orthodox School of ink landscape painting defined by the so-called four Wangs: Wang Shih-min (1592-1680), Wang Chien (1598-1677), Wang Yuan-ch'i (1642-1715), and Wang Hui (1632-1717). This new orthodoxy was based loosely on the painting styles of twelfth through fourteenth century masters as formulated in the theories of the great literatus, Tung Ch'i-ch'ang (1555-1636). Tung's codification was perceived as the orthodox, politically safe lineage for literati painting during most of the Ch'ing dynasty. This late nineteenth century work by Ku Yun in its light washes, clear composition, and horizontal strokes still reflects the basic values of the Orthodox tradition.",
