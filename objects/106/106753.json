  "text": "Since 1979, the spiral form has dictated much of Hunter's work.  Both <I>Rhythms in Chaos<I> and <I>Bahia Blossom<I> are from series he still pursues today, with carved flutes creating a voluptuousness of form.  From here Hunter started to open up his vessels by carving through the flutes, introducing voids.  An example, <I>Retusa Phantom<I>, can be seen nearby in the permanent gallery devoted to craft, G275.",
