After a few years, Lee decided to turn wood full time and in preparation for this career change he pursued formal training at the Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts in Tennessee.  The swirling tsunami depicted in this piece is an example of Lee's desire to \"breath[e] life into the work through gesture and movement.\"  ",
