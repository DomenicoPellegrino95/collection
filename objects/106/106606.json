  "text": "Marion Weeber was an independent American industrial designer who attended the progressive art school run by the Art Students League of New York.  She worked for several prestigious firms including Cartier, Ekco, and Samuel Kirk & Son, but eventually opened her own design firm in Manhattan in 1939.  She holds over twenty-five patents for her innovative and inventive designs.\r\n\r\n\"Classic Column\" is perhaps the most storied of Weeber's fifty-plus flatware designs.   It was selected by the U.S. Commission for Design Excellence for the American Pavilion at the 1967 International and Universal Exposition in Montreal.  Precise and polished geometric forms reflect an American industrial aesthetic, exemplifying the forward-looking image the United States wished to present to the world. \r\n",
