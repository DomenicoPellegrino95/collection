  "text": "Bencomo began turning wood after taking an interest in antique furniture restoration.  He valued the natural wood grains and fine craftsmanship of antique furniture and took up wood turning after moving to Hawaii in 1984.  Bencomo's work is inspired by his lifestyle and surroundings in Hawaii--a driftwood reference can be seen in this piece--as well as ancient Hawaiian traditions.  Bencomo uses primarily native Hawaiian woods as a way to pay homage to his adopted home.",
