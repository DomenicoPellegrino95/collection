  "text": "Ever in search of new subject matter, Fournier traveled to points of interest around the state. <I>Off the Coast</I> is rare evidence of the artistâ€™s visits to record scenery along the North Shore of Lake Superior. The drama inherent in many of his earlier large-scale works makes an appearance here through the plunging perspective, occasioned by the massive cliffs receding into the distance. The approach of the steamship injects an element of threat to the scene.\r\n\r\nWhen Fournier visited the North Shore, the sole means of access was by boat. Steamers plied the waters with passengers and supplies, destined for the small communities along the lake. Also, lacking road access, the burgeoning timber industry had not yet tapped the vast pine stands that covered areas close to the shore.",
