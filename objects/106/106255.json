  "text": "Psychedelic art was the most pervasive development in the popular culture of the late 1960s. Evolving from the hippie counterculture, this movement had its origins in graphics produced for rock album covers, concert posters, murals and comic books. It is characterized by fantastic subject matter, vibrant colors, extreme stylization and repetition of motifs. The textile industry enthusiastically adopted this style, but adapted it, making it more acceptable for use in home interiors and fashion.\r\n\r\nA number of minor design styles developed under the umbrella of Psychedelic art, including Flower Power, which focused on bold floral motifs, and historical revival styles that reinterpreted Art Nouveau patterns. <I>Fandango<I> combines the high-intensity colors of psychedelia with a 1960s rendition of Art Nouveau style.\r\n",
