  "text": "Potted at the Yaozhou kilns in Shanxi province, this bowl has a grooved rim and the interior is finely carved with two carnellia blossoms and an orchid-like flower in profile all encircled by leafy branches. The bowl is covered overall with a crackled sea-green glaze which shades to a deeper tone where it has pooled in the carved recesses. The neatly cut footrim is treated with a light brown wash which is typical of many Yaozhou celadons.",
