  "text": "Tutsi basket weavers are some of the most skilled in Africa, and tiny vessels such as this one are virtuoso examples of their abilities.  The smaller the basket, the more difficult it is to make, and thus the greater challenge to the artist.  These diminutive containers were created to hold gifts, adding value to the present through their beauty and the time and care taken in their construction.",
