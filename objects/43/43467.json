  "text": "In the 1980s, Richard Bosman produced a group of editioned woodcuts that featured scenes of disturbing or violent actions that suggested a specific, but unidentified narrative. The present work is a characteristic example from this group, depicting a scene of murder at sea in which an anonymous perpetrator beats his victim to death with what appears to be a rock. The victim's hands are seen just above the boat's gunnels in a defensive posture. The nighttime attack occurs in stormy seas under the glow of a full moon. The enigmatic nature of the characters and the narrative imbues the scene with a sense of mystery and intrigue. The heaving sea and the waves breaking against the nearest boat further amplify the raw violence of the murder in progress. ",
