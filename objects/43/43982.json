  "text": "A prolific etcher, Félix Buhot made only seven lithographs over a short period in 1892.  It is surprising that with so little exposure to the medium he decided to show the irregular shape of the lithographic stone.  This creative decision adds to the charm of The Little Hunter, as does the choice of green ink.  Like many of his etchings, Buhot fills the margins of his print with remarques, or extra drawings that are somewhat related to the central image.  Here we see rabbits, the hunter's quarry, as well as a lone frog in the lower right hand corner.",
