  "text": "Cyril Power’s dynamic Futurist-inspired arrangement of geometric forms and complementary color captures the essential form and rhythm of the nearly 200-step spiral staircase that connects Russell Square to a deep underground subway platform in the Bloomsbury section of London. Power was fascinated with the industrial architecture of London's underground rail system (the “Tube”), providing multiple subjects for his editioned prints while underscoring Power’s belief that art should express contemporary life.",
