  "text": "Glenn Ligon's art mines the history of African-American culture, from slave narratives to the \"Million Man March\" on Washington, D.C. In this portfolio of four untitled aquatints, Ligon addresses the issue of lingering racism in America by appropriating passages from the writings of renowned black authors. The two prints with black text on white paper feature excerpts from Zora Neale Hurston's 1928 essay \"How It Feels to Be Colored Me.\" Ligon writes, \"The prints play with the notion of becoming 'colored' and how that 'becoming' obscures meaning and also created this beautiful, abstract thing.\" The pair of prints with black text printed on black paper feature an excerpt from Ralph Ellison's 1952 novel \"Invisible Man,\" which describes blacks in America as ghosts, present and real, but remaining unseen because of pervasive racism. Together, the four prints symbolically represent the continued separation between the races.\r\n",
