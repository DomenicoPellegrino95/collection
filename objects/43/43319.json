  "text": "Wendel Dietterlin worked as an architekturmaler, decorating the ceilings, walls, and fa√ßades of people's homes. In his heart, however, he was an architect. Proof is his remarkable book Architectura. Its absurdist and at times nightmarish inventions make it a wonder even today. Presented in the form of a pattern book, Dietterlin's opus contains 203 plates organized around the five classical orders of architecture. These two prints are elaborations on the Corinthian (left) and Ionic (right).",
