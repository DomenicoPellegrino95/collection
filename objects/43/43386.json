  "text": "Given society's fear of women-particularly acute in the anxiety-ridden years before the millennium-it was but a small leap to the label of witch. In 1496, Nuremberg saw a second printing of Malleus Maleficarum (The Witches' Hammer), a handbook for detecting witches. It said women's insatiable desires made them throw in with the devil.

The \"O.G.H.\" on the globe may stand for O Gott hüte (O God protect).  ",
