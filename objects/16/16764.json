  "text": "While these silk banners would have only been used by the imperial court within the Forbidden City, their context was similar to this; flanking a shrine or an ancestor portrait above an altar table. The poetic verse invokes a heavenly constellation along with a wish for the emperor's longevity.\r\nThe banners read from right to left:\r\n \r\n<I>The court glows in rose color when the torches are lighted;\r\nMay the exalted one enjoy long life forever and ever and ever;\r\nMay he always see the light shining upon his great empire.\r\nThe propitious mist lusters the marvelous touches when the melodious heavenly music is performed;\r\nthe lofty central axis Mount Song is guarded by immortal isles. </I>",
