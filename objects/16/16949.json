  "description": "Court robe of faded, rust-colored k\\'ossu with nine five-clawed dragons in gold.  In ground, loosely drawn clouds, the eight Buddhist emblems, and bats in groups of five (Cf. 42.8.28) in shades of blue, rose, red, green, yellow, olive green, and soft violet.  Conventional border, close to 42.8.28, with branches of caral, symbols of Taoist and the Eight Precious things among waves.  Border repeated on sleeve at elbow where sleeve ends.  Traces of painting.  This robe never finished, and obviously unworn, since lower sleeve, collar band and fastenings are missing.  It is not slit, and is lined with thin pink silk.  K\\'ossu of good firm quality.",
