Chung, always represented as a fat man in need of a coat or vest, wears a brick-red scarf over his arms and belted at the waist to fall like a short skirt over pale blue trousers.  He carries his fan in the right hand and stands against a mountainous background in  shades of blue, green, tan, brown, yellow, and brick-red.  Above his head is seen part of a double peach. The panel has been lengthened by a strip across the top.",
