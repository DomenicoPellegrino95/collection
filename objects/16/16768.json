  "description": "Hanging of imperial yellow satin brocaded in an all-over design of large lotus blossoms and leaves in shades of pink, blue, violet, tan, mauve, peach, green and gold.  Lightly padded and lined with thin blue silk.  Note Mrs. Harris thinks this was made for the next to last emperor of China and hung at one side of the bed.  The hanging still bears creases of folds in which it hung and is faded in spots.",
