  "text": "This pair of red curtains would have been appropriate for use during festive occasions. Red is a festive and auspicious color to the Chinese. It figures prominently in decorative textiles for birthdays, anniversaries, and New Year's celebrations. The inclusion of imperial dragon imagery, using the same symbolic vocabulary of dragons, clouds, waves, and mountains seen in official court robes, indicates this set was most likely used in one of the residential halls of the imperial palace.",
