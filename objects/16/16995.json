  "text": "This large page is one of five owned by the museum from a dispersed manuscript of the great Persian text, the <I>Majmu'a-i Tavarijh<I> or Universal History, written by Rashid al-Din in 1318. Shah Rukh (1404-47), amir of Timur, who ruled Iran for the first half of the fifteenth century commissioned these leaves. The Universal History began with human creation and extended to events in Persian history. Of the five miniatures, this is not only the finest, but also perhaps the most famous of the set having been exhibited widely since it was first shown in London in 1931. However, its presence in the Universal History remains unexplained except for its intriguing title, \"the Dog Quara Braq (Black Lightening) drives the Wolves from the Sheep.\" It most likely illustrates an historical event emblematic of duty, loyalty, and bravery.",
