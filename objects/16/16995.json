  "text": "This folio is not only the finest, but also the most famous of Mia’s Majma al-Tavarikh set, having been exhibited widely since it was first shown in London in 1931. The subject is opaque, entitled, \"the Dog Qara Baraq drives the Wolves from the Sheep.\" This narrative also appears in Rashid al Din’s earlier text, The Universal History of the World, written in 1318.  It most likely illustrates an event emblematic of duty, loyalty, and bravery, as the black dog repels fearsome wolves, protecting the frightened sheep huddled within the rocks.",
