  "text": "This folio is the finest and most famous of the MIA’s <i>Majma al-Tavarikh</i> set, having been exhibited widely since it was first shown in London in 1931. The subject is opaque, but the narrative of Qara Baraq also appears in an earlier text that Hafiz i-Abru knew intimately, <i>The Universal History of the World</i>, written by Rashid al-Din in 1318.  It probably illustrates an event emblematic of duty, loyalty, and bravery, as the black dog repels fearsome wolves, protecting the frightened sheep huddled within the rocks.",
