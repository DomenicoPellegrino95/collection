  "text": "Following the official dress edicts of 1759, the so-called \"twelve symbols\" connoting imperial authority began to appear on certain of the emperor's formal and semiformal robes. The symbols are specifically paced: sun, moon, mountain, and constellation emblems are positioned symmetrically around the neckband, and the other eight symbols are arranged on the front and back of the robe. In theory, only the top members of the royal family-emperor, empress, empress dowager, and crown prince could wear twelve-symbol robes.",
  "description": "Emperor\\'s ceremonial twelve-symbol coat of yellow k\\'ossu with nine five-clawed dragons, those in profile clasping the Heavenly Jewel.  Background of loosely drawn cloud forms, bats, and good luck emblems in shades of blue, green, violet, red, rose, and gold.  At bottom wide border of tossing waves dotted with flowers, flower vases, swastika and other emblems.  At sides, center front and back where coat is slit, small areas of slanting, wavy stripes.  Similar reduced border at elbows, where sleeve is extended by a strip of ribbed yellow silk finished with cuffs of dark blue k\\'ossu.  Band of same dark blue k\\'ossu around neck and down front to under arm.  Coat lined with figured blue silk and lightly interlined.  Yellow ceremonial coats worn in sacrifices to earth.",
