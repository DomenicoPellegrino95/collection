  "text": "Basket weaving is an ancient art among the Akimel O'odham (Pima).  Although baskets were originally made strictly for functional purposes, over time, innovations occurred to reflect the taste of the buying public.  Market demand for smaller, more portable items created a new style, the miniature basket.  Incredibly difficult to produce, they showcase the weaver's skill.  These amazing works of art express the continued vitality and creativity of the Southwest basketry tradition.",
