  "text": "Like all stage costume, this colorful two-piece military outfit is an exaggeration of real life apparel. Plate armor is simulated with couched metal-wrapped threads, and padded applique lion masks adorn the shoulders and waist. The amount of elaborate studwork suggests this garment was used for the role of a general. The costume is one of several purchased during the 1920s from the stock of a theater within the Forbidden City.",
