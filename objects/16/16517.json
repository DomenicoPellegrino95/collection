  "text": "The majority of early eighteenth century dragon robes that have survived are made of relatively heavy silk brocade. The end of the century, however, the lighter tapestry weave called <I>k'o-ssu<I> and embroidered satin had become more popular. The official dress codes set forth in the <I>Huang ch'ao li-ch' i tu shih<I> states that the tawny yellow color of this robe was reserved for the emperor's sons, excepting the crown prince who was permitted to wear yellow like his father.",
  "description": "Imperial green gold brocade robe for a prince of the court (8 dragons instead of the imperial 9).  The symbol of a crowing cock backed by the rising sun appears on the front and sleeves, indicating the robe might have belonged to the heir apparent.",
