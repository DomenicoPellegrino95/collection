The end of the century, however, the lighter tapestry weave called <I>k'o-ssu</I> and embroidered satin had become more popular. The official dress codes set forth in the <I>Huang ch'ao li-ch' i tu shih</I> states that the tawny yellow color of this robe was reserved for the emperor's sons, excepting the crown prince who was permitted to wear yellow like his father.",
