The folds of drapery and other details are outlined in gold thread. At lower left an inscription reading\\'Second Emperor of the Period of Great Virtue\\', which would date the work as of the Yuan Period. The panel is framed in two sheets of glass, so that the back of the design is shown on the reverse. The Buddha is shown in the gesture of contemplation.",
