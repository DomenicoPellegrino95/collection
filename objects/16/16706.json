  "description": "Imperial robe of pale coral-colored k\\'ossu with nine 5-clawed dragons in gold. In ground loosely-drawn clouds, Taoist emblems, long-life characters, bats clutching a garlanded double peach in their mouths, and peonies in shades of blue, green, red, pink, and grey. Four of the ancient synbols the sun, moon, constellation, and mountains appear on this robe. Border of straight slanting stripes seperated by a line of regularly disposed, tight cloud forms from over-lapping waves among which appear Buddhist emblems, branches of coral, and to each side of sacred mountain a sprouting dragon.  Border repeated on  sleeve above a strip of dark blue k\\'ossu edged in gold and bright light blue. Collar band of the same. Robe slit at sides and with thin tobacco-brown figured in silk lining. Note nine dragons embroidered for emphasis. It is suggested that this robe belonged to the empress who had a fondness for coral. (But a man\\'s coat?)  cf. 42.8.52",
