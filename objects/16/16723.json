  "description": "Altar frontal of pale brick red k\\'ossu with design representing a blue-scaled chilin in a field of flowers, large fat clouds, and symbols in shades of blue, green, pink, yellow, brown and grey. Across the top a band of watery, run-together clouds.(?)   Note the bat, of finer, later k\\'ossu inset above cloud over chilin\\'s head. Double border inner one of worn, all-over flower and cloud pattern of brocade in shades of light green, yellow, blue and pink; outer of gold and blue k\\'ossu of dragon and cloud pattern, perhaps originally part of a robe? The k\\'ossu weave is quite coarse. It has been badly worn, and is mended in places. Lining of yellow satin which has been pieced out.",
