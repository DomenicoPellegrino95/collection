  "description": "Shaped hanging of pale mulberry-colored k\\'ossu, possibly made from larger hanging, as it is seamed up center from a wide \\'V\\' opening.  On each side a rampant 5-clawed dragon in gold in lower section; a phoenix medallion in upper.  Loose, rather fat clouds, jui and other symbols.  Waves and clouds at base of each side.  Colors include shades of green, red, blue, yellow, pink, olive-green, and orange.  The upper valance section is made up of four square fragments of k\\'ossu of wave, large cloud, and symbol design (from a larger piece) separated from themselves and from main field by borders of green satin brocade of Greek key diaper pattern.  The same brocade borders remainer of hanging.  In center of upper section a piece of dark blue and gold satin brocade with dragon medallions and good luck symbols.  Lining of gold-colored satin damask of cloud pattern.  A.P. says k\\'ossu squares in upper section should be removed and mounted separately.",
