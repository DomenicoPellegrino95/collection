  "description": "Court Robe of dull rust colored k\\'ossu with nine 5-clawed dragons in gold, those in profile clutching the Heavenly Jewel. In the ground loosely-drawn clouds and bats in groups of five in shades of red, pink, green, blue, and olive green. The arrangement of bats in groups of five has reference to the five greatest happinesses. Conventional border of slanting, slightly wavy stripes in body colors plus mauve and yellow seperated by a line of tight clouds from rolling waves and spray among which appear symbols of the Eight Precious Things and branches of coral. Border repeated on sleeve above a strip of dark blue silk damask of medallion designs. Cuffs and collar band of dark blue k\\'ossu in body designs; each edged with a band of drawn and gold brocade. Areas of painting in waves; sacred mountain and dragon detail. This robe has been shortened for a smaller wearer by taking a tuck at the waistline. Cf 42.8.36(Were there two Ch\\'ien Lung?) Slit at sides and lined with blue satin.",
