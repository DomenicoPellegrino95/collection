  "text": "Baskets of the Luiseño are known for the subtle elegance of their patterning.  They are usually made of  juncus rushes, which have a shiny, dark yellow appearance.  Luiseño women basket makers would manipulate these fibers into understated geometric designs as they built the vessel, resulting in the restrained aesthetic of the finished piece.  Baskets were used in every aspect of life in the California region, from ceremonial to everyday, and were a treasured and essential part of each family's possessions.",
