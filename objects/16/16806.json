Border design repeated at elbow, where sleeve continues with a strip of modern black sateen.  Cuffs, collar, and band embroidered with same designs and technique of body on blue satin.  Color scheme soft in tone, with shades of ivory, yellow, soft blue, green and brown predominating.  Robe slit front and back and lined with thin blue silk.",
