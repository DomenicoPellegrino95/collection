Remaining designs chiefly in satin stitch.  Border of deep slanting stripes almost straight on edges, topped with rolling waves scattered with swastika and other symbols.  Some knot stitch in border and in single flowers of body.  To right and left of sacred mountain, front and back, a pagoda under a spreading tree.  Border design repeated at elbow, where sleeve continues with a strip of modern black sateen.  Cuffs, collar, and band embroidered with same designs and technique of body on blue satin.  Color scheme soft in tone, with shades of ivory, yellow, soft blue, green and brown predominating.  Robe slit front and back and lined with thin blue silk.",
