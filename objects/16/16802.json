  "description": "Table mat of old tan satin brocaded with rows of dragon medallions and stylized clouds in soft shades of blue and green. Border of salmon-colored satin with later version of same design in green, rust, blue, and gold threads. Double binding of bright blue silk. Lining of pink cotton. Note this is the same design as in 42.8.174, but the brocade of the ground appears to be older that the other brocades.",
