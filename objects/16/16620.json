  "text": "In the ancient cultures found in the Pacific Coast region, shamans were known to transform into owls during sacred journeys. In this example from the Colima culture, the object may refer to this transitional process. The form of the vessel portrays that of an owl with the beak doubling as a spout for liquids, and the large eyes can refer to the bulging and dilated eyes of a shaman in trance.",
