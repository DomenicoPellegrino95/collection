  "description": "Runner made up of two narrow strips of faded, reddish-brown k\\'ossu (from panels of a robe?).  Each end of the strip contains a five-clawed dragon in gold grasping the heavenly jewel. Loosely drawn clouds, bats, Taoist and other symbols.  Beneath, the Eternal Sea motif with swastikas and Precious Thing symbols.  Colors include blue, green, red, pink, yellow, violet and olive green.  Border of black sateen bound with light blue cotton.  Lining of thin blue silk.  These pieces appear to have been the lower front sections of a court robe.",
