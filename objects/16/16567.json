  "description": "Kussaba, or square shawl.  Elaborate all-over design of floral arabesques and trailing vines in shade of red, green, yellow, and blue.  Black center with embroidered cartouche.  Border of flowering shrub, blossoms, arabesques, with supplementary border of strips of fringed wool of various colors.  An exceptionally fine example of weaving, with two sides almost identical in appearance.  Several holes and tears appear in border.  Cf. 30.62.4 which Mrs. Bovet thinks is the same and possibly woven by the same hand.  42.48 purchased in Pasadena; 30.62.4 at Liberty\\'s",
