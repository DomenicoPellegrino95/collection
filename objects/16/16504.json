  "text": "These shapes were most commonly made for the tourist market by the Akimel O'othom and Tohono O'odham in the mid twentieth century.  During their construction, while the materials are moist and soft, the walls or sides of the basket are pounded between two stones.  This flattens the coils and produces a very smooth, level surface.",
