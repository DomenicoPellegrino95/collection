  "text": "Albrecht Altdorfer made some of the smallest Renaissance prints and also contributed to some of the largest, including Maximilian I’s giant Triumphal Arch woodcut (more than 11 feet high). The son of a miniaturist, Altdorfer helped instigate the northern craze for tiny prints. In this example, his perspectival lines (he was also an architect) form a counterpoint to the rounded forms of the bather and her bonnet.",
