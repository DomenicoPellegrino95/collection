  "text": "Finding a print by the brilliant Dutch landscape painter Jacob van Ruisdael is as remarkable  as three travelers finding their way in this impossibly tangled forest. (Though hard to detect, they do have a dog to help them.) Compared to some 290 etchings by Rembrandt, Ruisdael is known to have done just 13 — this one being his last. This superior impression stars a favorite Ruisdael motif: a heroic tree (an oak) clawing its way into the earth.",
