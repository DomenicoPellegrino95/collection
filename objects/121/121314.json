  "text": "As a young man, Jan van Goyen filled numerous sketchbooks with black chalk studies made outdoors in the Dutch countryside. Such extensive practice gave him extraordinary fluency as a draftsman. He was also an astute observer of everyday life, and here he brings alive the varied activity of a small but lively community – trade and transport, gardening and blacksmithery – all set on a low horizon beneath a towering sky. Lingering figures, reflections on the water, and slowly drifting smoke tell us that the weathered is mild, but gnarled trees tell us that this is not always so. Today, only the ring of the hammer pierces the calm.",
