  "text": "Kubera, the god of wealth, has been incorporated into Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist religious pantheons.  This sculpture of the deity would have been built into a Hindu temple devoted to the god Shiva. Kubera adds breadth to the Mia’s holdings of South Asian sculpture by representing a class of divinity (yaksha) that the collection currently lacks.  It also represents a relatively early period within the Indian sculptural tradition.",
