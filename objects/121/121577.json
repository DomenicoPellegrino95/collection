  "text": "This portly dwarf leads the good life. His name is Kubera, and from his elaborate hairdo and fabulous jewelry to his cushy, lotus adorned throne, he radiates wealth and prosperity. In early Indic religions, Kubera was the king of a class of semi-divine nature deities known as yakshas. Later Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain religions incorporated Kubera into their divine pantheon as the god of wealth. His now missing left hand once held a sack of jewels, and two female attendants fanned him with flywhisks.    ",
