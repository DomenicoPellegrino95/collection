  "text": "For centuries carpets were treasured items, owned by the very wealthy and desired status symbols of newly rich Europeans. By the 18th century, with its wider distribution of disposable income, manufacturers began to develop less expensive floor coverings as alternatives to the highly-valued hand-knotted rugs. Several varieties of machine-woven strip carpeting were developed which were intended to be sewn together to form room-size rugs. The ingrain carpet, developed in Britain in the middle of the century, proved to be particularly popular and remained so for over a hundred and fifty years.<P>\r\nBy sewing together several panels, such as the one shown here, a large room-size carpet could easily be created. The resulting overall pattern was intended to complement the rich interior design sensibility of the late 19th century.\r\n",
