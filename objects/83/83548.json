Like the bowl from this period in the collection of the Minnesota Museum of American Art (shown nearby), the piece is a substantial canvas for a band of figures enclosed in ovoid shapes--here the females \"split\" into two male figures, an apparent reference to the act of procreation or childbirth.",
