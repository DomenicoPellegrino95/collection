  "text": "Ever since they opened their first pottery in Virginia, the Scheiers were prolific potters.  Once settled in Durham, at the University of New Hampshire in 1940, with access to a more efficient electric kiln and good supplies, their production increased further.  Ed and Mary's schedule was quite regular: they arose early, worked through the day and into the night, throwing, decorating, glazing, and firing pots, while Ed kept up his teaching schedule.  They were doing what they loved, although Ed's salary was modest.  As they did at Hillcrock Pottery in Virginia, they produced copious amounts of pottery to supplement Ed's income, mainly in the forms of utilitarian wares such as pitchers, mugs, bowls, plates, and various serving pieces.  Mary honed her natural skills producing these \"potboilers,\" as she referred to them, and the gray-glazed wares such as this set and the children's bowl and plate nearby were decorated by her as well.  Her charming animals, some entirely fantastical, were deftly painted in the manner of nineteenth-century folk potters.",
