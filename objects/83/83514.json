  "text": "This large colorful painting depicts Buddha Vairocana seated on a lotus flower throne. Flanked by <i>apsaras</i> (heavenly musicians), a jeweled canopy floats above the Buddha's head. In front and on either side are his two principal attending deities, the bodhisattva Manjusri on a lion and Samantabhadra on a six-tusk elephant. These are the bodhisattvas of wisdom and benevolence respectively. The lion and elephant each have attendants. The trinity is known in China as “Three Saints of Huayan”, and was created based on the influential Mahayana sutras such as <i>Avatamsaka Sutra</i> or <i>Flower Garland Sutra</i>. Full of pink, yellow, and purple clouds, the scene takes place in heaven as indicated by the large four-character inscription.",
