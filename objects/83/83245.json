  "text": "Joint label with 2003.228.32\r\nRings are a time-honored symbol of marriage. In Jewish tradition, an essential part of the marriage ceremony is the time of betrothal, during which the groom places a ring on the bride’s right hand as a symbol of their dedication to each other. The particular house-like bezel shape of these rings, traditionally used since the Middle Ages, hints at another element of Jewish marriage tradition in which marriage is equated with the establishment of a household. \r\nInside the bands are inscribed the initials “M” (מ) and “T” (ט), which stand for the phrase “Mazel tov” ( טוב מזל). This phrase is colloquially used as “Good luck.” “Mazel” is believed to come from the Hebrew word <I>mazal</I>, meaning “constellation” or “destiny,” and <I>tov</I>, meaning “good.” When more literally understood, the phrase acts as an affirmation that life has been favorable for a person and should be considered more akin to saying, “Congratulations.” In the marriage ceremony, this phrase is typically shouted at the end of the ceremony after the traditional breaking of the glass, thereby affirming that life has been and will, with God’s blessing, continue to be favorable for the couple.",
