  "text": "After moving to Oaxaca, Mexico, in 1968--where they had lived winters since their retirement in 1960 from the University of New Hampshire--the Scheiers produced very little work in clay.  The onset of Mary's arthritis brought her thirty-year pottery career to an end soon after their move, and Ed found other creative outlets involving local craftspeople.  Ed's growing familiarity with the geometric rugs and wall hangings of the native weavers led to the creation of his own designs for these artisans to complete.  A distinct blend of native tradition with more contemporary figural designs, these weavings were made by three families of Zapotec weavers in Teotitl√°n del Valle in Oaxaca beginning in 1958.  The weavers used the traditional serape technique, so that both sides of the weavings could be used, and they used natural dyes for most of the colors. Until the late 1970s, when the Scheiers moved to Arizona, they completed approximately seventy-five of Ed's designs, directed by full-scale cartoons and sketches indicating color.  The strong graphic quality emphasizes the themes on the two weavings shown in this gallery:  protection, and the Temptation of Adam and Eve.",
