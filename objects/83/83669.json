  "text": "Dramatic and elegant, Amish quilts from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania are immediately recognizable by their large planes of brilliant color and the simplicity of their designs. These quilts reflect the values cherished by this conservative religious community, a culture that discourages worldliness, vanity and idleness. Tradition dictates the overall form and the specific patterns that may be used. Within these restrictions, however, Amish quilters have considerable freedom to make personal aesthetic choices, such as color, color placement and quilting motifs.\r\n\r\nLancaster County quilts feature a large central panel, surrounded by solid color borders. The popular <I>Diamond in the Square<I> pattern evolved in the late nineteenth century and is unique to this particular Amish settlement. The large areas of plain fabric serve as ideal showplaces for the elaborate, skillful quilting that is the hallmark of Amish quilters.\r\n",
