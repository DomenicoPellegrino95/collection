  "text": "Mary Scheier's arthritis caused her to give up potting entirely by about 1970, and Ed did little potting while the couple lived in Mexico from 1968-78.  Once the couple returned to the United States, however, and saw the attention garnered by their earlier work, he was motivated to return to clay.  By 1980, he was developing a new body of work, selections of which are shown in this case.  Ed threw, glazed, and decorated the pieces, which were larger, more muscular, and more sculptural than his and Mary's New Hampshire work.  Figures are deeply incised and vigorously animated, often with faces pushed out from behind.  Ed produced hundreds of deeply-glazed stoneware vases, jars, bowls, plates, and other forms from 1980 until several years ago, when he finally gave up potting and moved to creating his art with the aid of a computer.
