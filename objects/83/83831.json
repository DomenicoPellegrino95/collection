  "text": "This is a bronze version of <I>Sevillanas<I>, one of Voulkos's early ceramic sculptures, which was included in his first one-man show of non-functional work, “Sculpture and Painting by Peter Voulkos,” held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York from February-March 1960. \r\n\r\nVoulkos was a serious student of flamenco guitar in the mid-1950s, and soon after was rarely seen without his guitar.  <I>Sevillanas<I> refers to a lively Spanish flamenco guitar rhythm typical of Seville.  The title and the form imply movement, with slab-built pieces assembled around a central cylinder, what Voulkos referred to as “the sculpture...building on itself.”   The patination, or exterior bronze color and texture, on this version is quite different from the ceramic sculpture, which is in the MIA's collection and currently on view in Gallery 275, the museum's permanent craft gallery.\r\n",
