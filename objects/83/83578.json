  "text": "Ed Scheier stepped into the new millenium several years ago, when he began what he refers to as the process of \"painting on the computer.\"  The resulting objects, technically prints, consist of new interpretations of several of Ed's familiar themes, including Adam and Eve as seen here, with manipulations of form and color not possible in any of his earlier media.  The ninety-three year old artist is constantly innovating and improving his technique.  He creates the works either by scanning drawings or by drawing on a Wacom tablet that is connected to his computer.  He manipulates the images with computer programs such as Painter 6 and Adobe Photoshop.",
