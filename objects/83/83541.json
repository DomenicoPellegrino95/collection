  "text": "Produced during the Scheiers' stay in Mexico, this piece was given to a family that stayed on the Scheiers' extensive property in Oaxaca in the 1970s and subsequently became good friends with the couple.  It is an example of the range of experimentation Ed undertook while simultaneously pursuing wood sculpture and weavings.  These mixed-media pieces often included heating wax on a copper plate, pressing paper into the wax, and drawing on the still-warm paper with wax pencils.  Ed also sometimes sifted dry pigment, sand, or other substances on the paper and later mounted it on board.  A particularly dominant Eve with a diminutive Adam resting on her snake-enclosing belly, this bold image fills the rectangular space provided by the support.",
