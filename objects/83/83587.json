  "text": "Ed Scheier's first sculptural efforts were the puppets he made during his brief but important puppeteering career in the 1930s--some even had heads of clay.  Ed enthusiastically began making freestanding clay sculptures at Hillcrock Pottery in 1939.  By the mid-1940s, after his war service, Ed began making table sculptures that resemble large plates folded at a 45-degree angle with figures placed at front, evoking a stage set.  Though many of these types of sculptures deal with Biblical themes, this piece was made to celebrate the large family of John B. and Barbara Davis--good friends of the Scheiers since the mid-1940s--after the birth of their eighth child.  The maternal form in the rear embraces her large brood, following one of Ed's favorite themes--protection.",
