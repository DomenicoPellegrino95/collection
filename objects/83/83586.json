  "text": "Because the Scheiers were largely self-taught potters, without any formal knowledge of the chemistry of glazing, Ed says that they learned about glazes \"only in a sort of empirical way, not ever with a real understanding of the chemistry of it...we just stumbled on things.\"  This pot with its abstract patches of color was made to test four glaze types, each numbered on the bottom, and was probably made by Ed, who did most of the glazing and decorating of the Scheiers' work.",
