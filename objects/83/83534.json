  "text": "This elegant bowl, along with the larger bowl and teapot in this case, are proof of Mary Scheier's ability to produce very elegant, thinly-potted wares in the manner of their contemporaries in California, émigré potters Gertrud and Otto Natzler, or even of Ming dynasty Chinese ceramists.  Subtly glazed but undecorated, these pieces allow the viewer (or user) to concentrate on the purity of their respective forms.  This bowl was purchased around 1951 for use in a Frank Lloyd Wright-designed home in Minneapolis.",
