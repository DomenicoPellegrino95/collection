In traditional Jewish practice, one uses a two-handled cup such as this to wash hands before morning prayers, before meals, or before saying a blessing during important holiday ceremonies such as the Passover Seder.  Depending on the tradition, one alternates pouring water over the right hand, then the left, two to three times.",
