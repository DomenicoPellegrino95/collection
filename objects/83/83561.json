  "text": "Ed's exposure to the native crafts of Oaxaca not only inspired him to design weavings (two of which are shown in this gallery), but also to create freestanding sculpture in wood.  The native guanacastle wood, easily carveable and made into large winnowing bowls by native Mexicans, intrigued Ed, and he purchased a number of these bowls, transforming them into expressive figural sculpture.  The shallow, rounded form of the bowls was perfectly suitable for exploring themes of love and protection, and Ed often accentuated the forms with paint, sand, jute, or nails.  The final result bears an interesting resemblance to pre-Columbian sculpture, something the Scheiers collected and admit was a broad inspiration on their work.  Ed also found tall pieces of guanacastle that he fashioned into totem-like sculptures.  A photograph of Ed in Arizona (shown in this gallery) with several of the nearly one hundred wood sculptures that he made during the 1970s testifies to the powerful presence of these objects.",
