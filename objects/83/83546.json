  "text": "Along with the gray-glazed pitchers, mugs, and children's dishes shown in this gallery, Mary and Ed Scheier produced large numbers of serving pieces, especially casseroles in various sizes, to supplement their income while Ed taught at the University of New Hampshire in the 1940s and 1950s.  Most of these heavy serving pieces have a quite modern spiral pattern inside; this handsome example has a flaring trumpet-like handle on the lid.",
