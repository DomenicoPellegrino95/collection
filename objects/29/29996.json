  "text": "This fork and knife set is named after Lilliput, the fictional island with tiny inhabitants in <I>Gulliver's Travels</I> (1726) by Jonathan Swift.  Lilliput was at war with its neighboring island over which end of a boiled egg should be eaten first.  \"Lilliput\" became a popular term for miniature, as well as a subtle reference to dining etiquette.  The  inscription on the box of this small flatware set indicates it was given as a Christmas present in 1866.",
