Lilliput was at war with its neighboring island over which end of a boiled egg should be eaten first.  \"Lilliput\" became a popular term for miniature, as well as a subtle reference to dining etiquette.  The  inscription on the box of this small flatware set indicates it was given as a Christmas present in 1866.",
