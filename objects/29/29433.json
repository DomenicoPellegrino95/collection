  "text": "The talismanic quality of a plant underlies the belief that planting certain flowers near one's home or placing them on the gates would protect the household from evil. The long-bladed grass of the sweet flag (<I>Acorus calamus</I>), with its strong aroma, was believed to ward off poisonous insects and evil forces. Therefore it was customarily hung on doors on the occasion of the May (<I>Duanwu</I>) Festival on the fifth day of the fifth moon. The figure with his hand holding a sword is Zhong Kui, a deity who exorcises ghosts and evil spirits. His image is often painted on household gates as a guardian spirit, as well as in places of business where high-value goods are involved.",
