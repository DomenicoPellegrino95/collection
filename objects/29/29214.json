  "text": "Serpents are a recurring theme in Maya mythology and are variously referred to as a <I> plumed serpent<I>, <I> feathered serpent<I>, <I> double-headed serpent<I> or <I> sun serpent<I>. They all appear to be related <I>K'uk'ulkan<I>, a Maya god who participated in the creation of the earth and humanity. \r\nThe serpent plays an important part in Maya iconography and is found in a variety of forms on Maya textiles. In this huipil it is symbolized by the 'S' shaped motif, but the horizontal, rayed zigzag is also said to represent this mythical being. <I>Cintas<I>, the long, narrow ribbons used to wrap and tie women's hair, are said to be another manifestation of serpent imagery.\r\n",
