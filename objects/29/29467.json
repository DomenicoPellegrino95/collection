  "text": "Glazing techniques improved greatly between the eleventh and eighth centuries b.c. Large quantities of high-fired glazed stonewares similar to this jar have been excavated in the Yangtze River area at Tun-hsi in Anhui province and at Ch'u-chou in Chekiang province. Surface decoration is achieved by incising, impressing with molds, and with wheel-made grooves. The olive-green glaze, derived from a two-percent iron oxide compound, can be considered a form of celadon. The distribution of high-fired glazed ware during Western Chou was far-reaching with examples found in Hopei, Shantung, Honan, Shansi, Anhui, Kaingsi, Chekiang, and Kiangsi provinces in north central and south China.",
