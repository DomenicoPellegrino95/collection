  "text": "Stone cladding over steel, moving up foot by foot—Hine captures the exciting construction of what would be New York’s tallest building, complete with the rendering on the billboard at street level. Though this view is monumental, Hine was interested in the human aspect of building skyscrapers, and collected his views of the construction of the Empire State Building in the book Men at Work (1932). He didn’t take a machine-age view of the Empire State’s construction, but a zoomorphic one, likening it to a gossamer web and its builders as “spiders spinning a fabric of steel against the sky.” ",
