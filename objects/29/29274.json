  "text": "Shi Ke-fa (1602-1645), was a respected general who fought against the Mauchus at the end of the Ming dynasty. He was also known as a poet. This couplet, derived from one of his poems, could have been hung side-by-side or used to flank a larger single painting centered above a large altar table. The poems express the author's strong, literary values.\r\n\r\n<P>The large script couplet reads:\r\nright: <I>Drinking wine while browsing through history.<I>\r\nleft: <I>Reading the classics in the tranquil aroma of burning incense.<I>\r\n\r\n<P>The small script dedications and inscriptions read:\r\nright: <I>Beautiful words recently collected in my study (named the \"awakening heart\" studio). <I>\r\nleft: <I>According to the teachings of the eminent Taoist master Wengnian (written by) younger brother Daolin Shi Ke-fa.<I>",
