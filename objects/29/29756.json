  "text": "This elegantly fashioned, early ink stone is carved in the form of a winnowing basket, a favored shape during T'ang. The artisan has cleverly carved the light-grained stone to reveal a dark striation in the center of the well which simulates puddled ink. The small scale and fine condition suggest that this was an object made exclusively for burial.",
