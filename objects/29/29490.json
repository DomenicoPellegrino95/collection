  "text": "\"Kentucky rifles\" of the late-18th and early-19th centuries were primarily made in Pennsylvania, receiving their nickname from the song \"The Battle of New Orleans\" during the War of 1812: \"But Jackson he was wide awake, and wasn't scar'd of trifles, for well he knew what aim we take, with our Kentucky Rifles.\"  John Bonewitz, who worked in Berks County, Pennsylvania, was one of the finest craftsmen of this type of rifle.  His firearms are prized for their elegant proportions, beautifully carved leaves and scrolls, and engraved brass patch boxes and butt plates.  Compare the carving and patch box design of this piece to those of the Dickert rifle from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, also in this case.",
