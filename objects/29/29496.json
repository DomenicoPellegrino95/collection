  "text": "Yang Ki-hun was a member of the Royal Academy of Painting at the end of the Choson dynasty. Despite the official nature of his position, however, his style reflects the untrammeled spirt of a literati artist. He is best known for his paintings of birds and plants, which he rendered in a delightfully abbreviated and naive style. The inscription, also by Yang, suggests the sudden changing of seasons:\r\n\r\n<P><I>Like a dream,<I>\r\n<P><I>the wind blows from the south<I> \r\n<P><I>bringing cold rain.<I>",
