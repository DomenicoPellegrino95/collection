  "text": "For the Fulani of the Guimbau region of Mali, blankets are essential parts of a bride's trousseau. The bride's father commissions the creation of five blankets, the wedding blanket or arkila kerka, meaning mosquito net, being the largest and most important. During the winter months of November to January, Fulani cattle herders need protection from the cold, as well as from mosquitoes; these blankets are produced to meet this need. In addition, the blankets can serve as room-dividers.\r\n\r\nWedding blankets are composed of five or more narrow woven bands that are sewn together lengthwise. Their aesthetic reflects the influence of North America textile traditions on weavers south of the Sahara, and their patterns closely parallel those of Berber weavers.",
