  "text": "In the late 1760's, Nicolas-Bernard Lépicié achieved great renown as a painter of genre scenes. Like his contemporaries Chardin and Greuze, Lépicié was chiefly inspired by the cabinet pictures of the seventeenth century Dutch School. Lépicié specialized in depictions of humble scenes featuring mischieveous children, dutiful servent girls, diligent spinners and enrapt card players. The present drawing is remarkable for the delicacy of execution and the unfaded freshness of the watercolor passages.",
