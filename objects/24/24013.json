  "text": "These two photographs are hung for the Institute's monthly Third Thursday event, which takes place the evening of July 16. As is apparent from the images, July's theme is bicycling.\r\n\tPhotographers Peter de Lory and Gary Sherman both present formalist images, revealing their strong interest in picture structure. De Lory tightly framed his subject on a plane parallel to the camera and Sherman carefully created an almost symmetrical composition. De Lory's image is a sunny action scene, celebrating the freedom of riding a bicycle. Sherman's, on the other hand, is a dark still life, comprised of two views (by double exposure) of the same bike frame, bent in an accident.        \r\n",
