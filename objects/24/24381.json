Sprays of small flowers accompany thin bands of <I>rocaille<I> (shell encrusted or pebbly) motifs, woven with gold and silver, as well as multi-colored threads.\r\n\r\nThis panel may have been part of a furniture fabric for a matched set of chairs and sofas used in an elegant French reception room.",
