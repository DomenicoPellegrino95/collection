  "text": "Jules Chéret was churning out 200,000 posters a year by the mid-1880s, transforming Parisian streets into what art critic Roger Marx called \"an open-air museum.\" Chéret's signature was the \"chérette,\" seen here in her usual guise: radiant, fey, seductive. Yet Chéret's contribution to L'Estampe originale catered to collectors' tastes for the unique. Instead of the bold, circus feel of his mass-produced posters, this print is muted, intimate, and atmospheric. The light-handed use of the lithographic crayon only adds to the transparency of the chérette's notoriously filmy costume.    \r\n",
