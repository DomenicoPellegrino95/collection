  "text": "Albert Birkle’s Der Postagent Hausler (The Telegraph Operator) was created during the age of the Weimar Republic (1919 - 33), the time in Germany after the devastating First World War and before the rise of the Nazi Party. Expressionism had ended and New Objectivity took its place. Rather than brushstrokes of emotion, these German artists of the Golden Twenties turned to newfound realism to express themselves. Portraits were a common theme, but were used to describe social types instead of individualities. Birkle’s Telegraph Operator demonstrates this and shows a man and his profession, but not his personality. However, one can still sense the anxiety of the war through the operator’s eyes and the spying stare of the messenger in the background.",
