  "text": "In the 1890s, fortified by symbolist literature, artists searched for imagery to express the workings of the mind -or what painter and designer Victor Prouvé called \"inner commotion.\" Fin-de-siècle research into the unconscious and suggestibility, in fact, was being pioneered in Prouvé's hometown of Nancy. In this sickly green symbolist miasma, he evoked anxiety by picturing a menacing dream state in which raptors engage in beak-to-beak combat and buzzards await their next meal. ",
