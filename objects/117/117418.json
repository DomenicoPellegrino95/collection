  "text": "The Kan' school of influential painters working for the shogunate was one of the most important Japanese painting schools for the landscape genre. They were responsible for decorating the residences and castles of affluent and high-ranking samurai. Sansetsu headed the branch in Kyoto while Tan'yu (1602'74) lead the Edo branch. By the beginning of the Edo period (1603'1868), the Kan' painters turned to a more subdued, refined style that coincided with a renewed interest in monochrome ink painting.",
