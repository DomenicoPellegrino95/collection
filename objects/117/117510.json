  "text": "Popular as a decorative motif, the poetic morning glory is a fitting background for the verses interspersed among the curling and climbing vines and the multitude of blossoms. This fan, retrofitted into a hanging scroll, is the oldest Rinpa painting in the Clark collections. The Rinpa school (literally “School of Rin”), named after Ogata Kōrin (1658–1716), is not a painting school in the traditional sense—a teacher imparting techniques to disciples—but rather a group of artists who followed the same style by copying earlier masters, without a strictly academic system. Characteristics include the stylized motifs and the “boneless” painting technique (mokkotsu), in which outlines are abandoned and subjects become flat, reduced to their essence.",
