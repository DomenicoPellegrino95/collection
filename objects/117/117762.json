  "text": "An old folk tale adapted into a popular Noh play, the Takasago story tells of two ancient pines, one in Takasago and the other in Sumiyoshi, personified by an old couple. A Shinto priest runs across the pair and learns that each night the old man in Sumiyoshi visits his wife in Takasago, despite the great distance, in a show of fidelity. Here, Sekka poses the old couple beneath a stylized pine tree, rendered using the tarashikomi technique, in which a second layer of ink is applied before the first has dried, creating a puddled look.",
