  "text": "Baiitsu, a scholar-painter from Nagoya, shows his mature painting style in this monumental mountain landscape, the misty areas between the peaks and the dense foliage creating a lush, peaceful atmosphere. \r\nThe inscription reads: \r\nAt the valley-mouth, my bramble gate is visited by no guest: \r\nafter rainfall, fragrant paths have a covering of green. \r\nMy mountain lad calls me from sleep, \r\ndisturbing my tranquil withdrawal: \r\nthe whole courtyard is filled with setting sunlight, \r\namong the bamboo shadows.\r\n(translated by Jonathan Chaves)",
