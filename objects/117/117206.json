  "text": "The figure of Dakiniten in this scroll exemplifies Buddhism’s ready assimilation of native gods. The deity entered the Buddhist canon as a converted Hindu goddess, and is shown riding a fox—the messenger of the Shinto kami, or deity, known as Inari. The fox’s legs are wrapped in snakes, a reference to another converted Hindu goddess, Benzaiten.",
