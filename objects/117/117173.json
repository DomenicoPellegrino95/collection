  "text": "Yoshitoshi was one of the last masters of <i>ukiyo-e<i> in the Meiji period. A pupil of Utagawa Kuniyoshi (1797–1861), he also studied with Kikuchi Yōsai (1788–1878), a master of historical painting. Yoshitoshi merged the <i>ukiyo-e<i> style with Western realism to produce a new form of print for the modern audience. His historical and heroic prints were often bizarre and ghoulish. This is one of his best paintings with the eyes of the ghost ominously shining in pale blue.",
