  "text": "Yoshitoshi was one of the last masters of ukiyoe in the Meiji period. A pupil of Utagawa Kuniyoshi (1797'1861), he also studied with Kikuchi Y'sai (1788'1878), a master of historical painting. Yoshitoshi merged the ukiyoe style with Western realism to produce a new form of print for the modern audience. His historical and heroic prints were often bizarre and ghoulish. Here, only the eyes of the ghost shine ominously in pale blue.",
