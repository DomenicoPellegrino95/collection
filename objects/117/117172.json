  "text": "Though unsigned, Three Beauties shows the idiosyncratic style of Mihata Jōryō’s beauties. Whereas their faces look similar at a glance, Jōryō juxtaposes three different types of femininity; a courtesan holding folded tissue paper, a geisha with a fan, and a city girl. Each one represents a different type of charm through their gesture and eye expression.\r\nMihata Jōryō was active in Kyoto during the Tenpō era (1830-1844). His paintings of beauties with clear-cut features and luxuriously designed kimono became very fashionable and by the third quarter of the nineteenth century, there were many followers of his style. However, not much is known about Jōryō himself, even his name is unclear. He is commonly called Jōryū, but his seals read Jōryō, which therefore seems to be the proper way to pronounce his name. There is also no signature reading Mihata, but instead he sometimes signed his family name as Yokoyama.",
