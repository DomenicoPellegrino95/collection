  "text": "Mihata Jōryō was active in Kyoto during the Tenpō era (1830-1844). His paintings of beauties with clear-cut features and luxuriously designed kimono became very fashionable. By the third quarter of the nineteenth century, there were many followers of his style. Even in modern paintings of beauties in Kyoto, one can find his influence. However, not much is known about Jōryō himself. Jōryō is said to have studied under the Shijō school artist, Okamoto Toyohiko (1773-1845). Jōryō’s name is also unclear. He is commonly called Mihata Jōryū, but his seals read Jōryō and not Jōryū, therefore Jōryō is probably the proper way to pronounce his name. There is also no signature reading Mihata. Instead he sometimes signed his family name as Yokoyama, and there is no document explaining why he is called Mihata.",
