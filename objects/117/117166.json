Reversing the sacred and the profane in a kind of parody was a favorite motif during the Edo period'in Edo slang, to 'pull out one's nose hair' implied a man enslaved by a woman. An especially popular theme was that of the Daruma and the courtesan, a play on the familiar subjects of Daruma's nine years of meditation facing a stone wall, which caused the loss of his arms and legs, and the courtesan's 10 years of trial-laden life at a brothel'the word 'daruma' was slang for a prostitute.",
