  "text": "In 1159, the powerful clan leader Minamoto Yoshitomo was defeated by Taira Kiyomori, and Lady Tokiwa fled through the snow with their three children: Imawaka, Otowaka, and Ushiwaka (aka Minamoto Yoshitsune, destined to become one of the most famous samurai warriors). No other works are known by the mysterious Kunitsugu, and until recently it was believed that this painting dated to the 1820s. However, the discovery of the similar-looking print by Kuniyoshi from around 1848 suggests differently. The painting cannot have been done prior to the print as Kuniyoshi was a successful and well-known artist who would not have copied a work by an unknown painter. It seems plausible then that Kunitsugu created the painting after Kuniyoshi's print, perhaps on commission.",
