  "text": "Comprising 12 scenes of lovemaking, the scroll begins with a list of erotic books from China and Japan, playfully creating an air of connoisseurship. The first three scenes, in which couples of an imagined classical China are engaged in various stages of intimacy, are painted in ink on paper, while the following nine episodes, showing Japanese couples of the past and present, are executed in colors on silk. This exhibition is the first public display of this artwork.",
