  "text": "Kinkakuji, the “Temple of the Golden Pavilion,” is a Zen Buddhist temple and garden complex in Kyoto founded in 1379. Officially “Deer Garden Temple” (Rokuonji), the temple is named after its famous golden pavilion, one of Kyoto’s most iconic sights. However, the pavilion seen today is a reconstruction, as the original building was burnt down by a novice monk in 1950.\r\nBeing an ardent traveler, Hiroshi often included non-Japanese subjects in his work, such as the Swiss Alps, India, or Korea. His skill at transferring the subtle color gradations of painting to woodblock prints, and conveying the constant change stirred up by nature, vastly contributed to the renaissance of woodblock prints in the early 20th century.",
