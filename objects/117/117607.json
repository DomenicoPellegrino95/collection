  "text": "The distinct seated pose, known as “royal ease,” identifies this figure as Nyoirin Kannon, one of the six manifestations of Kannon Bosatsu in Esoteric Buddhism. In one hand, he holds a wish-granting jewel near his chest, while the hand hanging to his right holds a string of prayer beads. Lost to time are a lotus blossom that would have been held in the left hand near his chest and a Dharma Wheel on the tip of his upraised finger. Of his remaining two arms, one rests on his cheek while the other lies flat on the ground, bracing him to the earth of Mount Fudaraku, where this manifestation is said to reside.",
