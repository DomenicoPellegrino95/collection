  "text": "At the moment of his death, the Buddha was said to enter nirvana. Around him are his disciples in monks’ robes, a group of five bodhisattvas with golden-yellow skin, guardian deities, monks, laymen, and animal beings. From above, the Buddha’s mother Maya descends with her entourage. All are shown expressing profound grief, and even the usually fierce, red-skinned Niō tumble in distress at the front of the dais.",
