  "text": "Buddhist monks, particularly those of the Zen school, were devoted landscape painters. Like calligraphy, painting was considered part of the spiritual training necessary for enlightenment. Zen monks favored monochrome ink painting due to its simplicity and straightforwardness. The priest Kenko_ Sho_kei, who served as secretary at Kencho_ji Temple in Kamakura, studied Chinese paintings from the Song and Yuan dynasties and became a key figure in the ink-painting circles of Japan.",
