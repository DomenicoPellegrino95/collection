  "text": "Nakabayashi Chikutō belonged to a circle of conservative literati painters in the nineteenth century that sought to emulate the techniques of selected masters of China. Here form is built from Mi dots; short, horizontal lines made with the side of the brush. Unpainted areas convey sheets of rain and rising mist. The variation in tone makes the work seem to shimmer, imparting the sense of sunshine breaking though storm clouds on a summer afternoon. The poem is inscribed by the Confucian scholar-poet Hirose Seison (Seison Hanji).\r\nInscription\r\n雨気不離山\r\n漲痕方上路\r\n水風吹夕雲\r\n失却邨南楼\r\nThe spirit of rain does not leave the mountain.\r\nThe rain proceeds up the road.\r\nThe watery wind drives the evening cloud\r\nObscuring the watchtower at the south of the village\r\n(Transl. by Masato Nishimura) ",
