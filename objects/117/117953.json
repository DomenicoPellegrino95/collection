  "text": "Nakabayashi Chikuto_ belonged to a circle of conservative literati painters in the nineteenth century that sought to emulate the techniques of selected masters of China. Here form is built from Mi dots; short, horizontal lines made with the side of the brush. Unpainted areas convey sheets of rain and rising mist. The variation in tone makes the work seem to shimmer, imparting the sense of sunshine breaking though storm clouds on a summer afternoon. The poem is inscribed by the Confucian scholar-poet Hirose Seison (Seison Hanji).",
