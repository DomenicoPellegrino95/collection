  "text": "Two doves are sitting close to each other in a blooming Mountain Japanese Apricot tree. They almost disappear in the massive tree with many young twigs, part of which is slightly covered behind a band of fog. Between 1924 until 1956 Onda Tokuju participated numerous times in various art exhibition-competitions in Japan, including the government-sponsored, prestigious Nitten. His 1924 debut work was Mountain Japanese Apricot (Yabai) that is stylistically and compositionally very similar to this work which won the Bronze Award at an exhibition of the Japan Art Association.",
