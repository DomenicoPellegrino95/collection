  "text": "Buddhist “achievers” or rakan strive for “awakening”—enlightenment—and the attaining of nirvana. Rakan could be depicted in a more natural, life-like manner or with grotesquely distorted features. The image of the running waterfall in the background and a deer standing next to a seated rakan figure might depict the third rakan, Kanaka, who vowed to protect the Buddha’s Law.",
