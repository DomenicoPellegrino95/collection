  "text": "Buddhist 'achievers' or rakan strive for 'awakening''enlightenment'and the attaining of nirvana. Rakan could be depicted in a more natural, life-like manner or with grotesquely distorted features. The image of the running waterfall in the background and a deer standing next to a seated rakan figure might depict the third rakan, Kanaka, who vowed to protect the Buddha's Law.",
