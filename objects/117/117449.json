  "text": "The Daoist immortals, Gama Sennin (Chin. Liu Hai) and Tekkai Sennin (Chin. Li Tieguai) were often paired in Japanese and Chinese art because of their corresponding supernatural powers. Depicted on the right is Gama Sennin, known literally as the ‘toad hermit,’ a character based on the historical civil servant and alchemist Liu Hai of 10th-century China. Gama was thought to be able to release his spirit from his body, metamorphose, and fly with the aid of his magical companion. Tekkai Sennin was thought to be capable of leaving his body, sometimes traveling for extended periods. Like Gama Sennin, he is associated with medicine, and is traditionally represented with a gourd that signifies his ability to transcend the body and to offer healing.",
