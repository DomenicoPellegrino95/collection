  "text": "The simplistic rounded lines, large eyes, and silver glitter of Dear Bear are inspired by the popular Japanese Kawaii style, meaning cute or adorable. If you’re familiar with Hello Kitty, you’ve seen this style, often associated with mass-produced goods and popular cartoons. But Akira’s work blurs the line between consumer products and fine art. That shiny surface, for instance, has deep roots: it’s Urushi, an ancient, natural Japanese lacquer technique that gives Akira’s sculptures a protective, nearly plastic quality suggestive of mass-produced Kawaii products.
