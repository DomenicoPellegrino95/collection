  "text": "Low folding screens such as this were originally used to block the heat of the portable brazier (furo), used to prepare water for tea, from participants to a tea gathering during the warm months of the summer. Such screens later became largely decorative. This modern furosaki features a bamboo design in colored lacquer, with gold and silver maki-e and strips of mother-of-pearl inlays, which pop against the glossy roiro background.",
