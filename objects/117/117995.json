  "text": "Okada Hankō’s monumental work is a tour de force in the spirit of the Four Wangs, a circle of conservative Chinese painters who created stylized interpretations of classic works. This painting follows orthodox principles of composition—the foreground, middle-ground, and background are distinct yet well-integrated—maintaining order in this otherwise fantastical, complex setting. \r\n \r\nThe inscription reads: \r\nThe water is gone from the stony river that has a disorderly look.\r\nThe leaves are gone from the mountain that has a wonderful scene.\r\nThe thoroughly wet old man on the bridge, where will he go'\r\nThere is a western village where an unsettled game of Go is waiting for him.\r\nTenth month, 1840\r\n(translated by Masato Nishimura)",
