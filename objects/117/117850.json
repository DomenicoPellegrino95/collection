  "text": "The God of Wind and the God of Thunder seem to be based on Hindu deities that were assimilated into the Buddhist pantheon and merged with indigenous Shintō personifications of the elements. In this version, the Thunder God on the right screen is recognizable by his red skin and drums. The Wind God typically appears as a horned, gargoyle-like creature with green skin and a cloth sack from which he unleashes blasts of wind. On the left screen, however, Kyōtei equipped him with a pair of fans. Another departure from established iconography is the addition of the Rain God, shown with flasks of water and crowned with a dragon, a beast associated with rain in East Asian culture. The innovative interpretation established these screens as his masterpiece.\r\n(2013.29.7.1-.2)",
