  "text": "According to Bai Juyi’s (772–846) “Song of Everlasting Sorrow,” the love story between the Tang dynasty Emperor Xuanzong (685–762; reigned as Minghuang) and his reportedly breathtaking concubine Yang Guifei (719–756) is among the most tragic of all time. A rebellion in 755 forced Xuanzong to flee the capital. Angry imperial guards, believing that Yang Guifei was responsible for Xuanzong neglecting state affairs, demanded her execution. Xuanzong abdicated the throne shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nBai Juyi’s poem influenced popular Heian period literature such as The Tale of Genji, and this tragic love affair became a popular subject among Kanō school artists, of which this six-panel folding screen is a formidable example. This is the left half of a pair of screens; the right half, showing the Queen Mother of the West, is in the Idemitsu Museum of Arts in Tokyo.",
