  "description": "Landscape in snow with very eerie feeling. At top right is snowy mound, from bottom right corner to center of composition extends land formation in interlocking areas of blue and white formations, reminiscent of Hokusai's rendering of mountain sides and land formations in blue and white. At lower right of this part is a bridge with a traveler crossing it and a river underneath. At center bottom is land showing some huts with a couple trees. Snowy landscape continues from center to left edge but the space enclosed is mysterious--cannot tell whether it is land or not. Also are some horizontal bands which were at one time areas of mist or clouds in gold paint.",
