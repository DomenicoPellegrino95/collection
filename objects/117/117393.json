  "inscription": "along right edge, in black: Misty, hazy, dawn comes to the village; / Chatter, chatter, morning market starts! / A gentle breeze sways willows at the gateway; / Early sunlight climbs plums by the eaves. / With the four seas, new auspiciousness awaited! / The threefold capital recovers from olds disaster. / Stabilized, the turbulence of foreign barbarians; / From distant places, treasures offered in tribute. / So busy! We laugh at those hurrying birds. / So loud! We love the flashing lightning. / Heaven now expunges the darkly brooding; / Man begins to gaze up at vast sky. / In the garden out back, they gather oranges, / Along the stream in front, pluck the purple moss. / At the southern window, we invite guests to drink, / Under clear skies, snowlight glittering deep in our cups.
