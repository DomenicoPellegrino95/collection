  "text": "In the whirlwind, God descends below the clouds into this world; now he has returned to heaven and brought man with him, as indicated by the cloud on which the Deity stands:\r\n\r\nGod Appears & God is Light\r\nTo those poor Souls who dwell in Night\r\nBut does a Human Form Display\r\nTo those who Dwell in Realms of Day\r\n(The last four lines of Blake's Auguries of Innocence)\r\n\r\nThe friends are still in the night, and the light to them is intolerable; but Job and his wife face God and know him for a comrade, in whose image they were made: \"we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as He is.\"\r\n\r\nThe angel in the margin below is the Comforter, who is the Spirit of Truth. Her texts (all from the Gospel of Saint John) assert the identity of the Son with the Father, who loves all his children equally, unprejudiced by their virtues or vices. Two of the texts appear in books; the most important is on a scroll. Scroll and books are now in harmony.\r\n",
