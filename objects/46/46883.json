  "text": "This ink landscape bears the inscription:\r\n<P><I>Viewing the waterfall at Shih-liang. During the early autumn of the year 1738 during the Ch'ien-lung reign era, I painted this for submission to the judgement of my venerable elder brother, Chang Keng from Hsiu-shui.<I>\r\n<P>Attended by a servant bearing wine and a drinking cup, a scholar with staff pauses while crossing a stone bridge to gaze out on a serene landscape. Shih-liang or \"Stone Bridge\" is the name of a famous cave in Chekiang province that is approached by a natural stone bridge. It is the theme of many paintings. The man most likely portrayed here and the recipient of this painting was Wang Yu-tseng (1706-1762), born in Hsiu-shui, Chekiang province. He was a calligrapher who earned his <I>chin-shih<I> (doctorate) degree in 1754 and served as a secretary in the Ministry of Justice in Peking. The artist, Chang Keng, was a younger friend of Wang's and from the same town in Chekiang.\r\n",
