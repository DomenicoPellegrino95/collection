  "text": "In plate one, Job and his family are still in the pastoral state of Innocence and shown at their evening prayers. Job is basically a good man, although he never recognized the true God. A Gothic church to the left represents his spiritual wealth; to the right, the flocks and barns represent his material wealth. Job fears God instead of loving him as a friend and deepest of all is his secret pride which must be humbled.",
