  "text": "The subject of this magnificent etching is the Palazzo Dario, a famous landmark located on Venice's Grand Canal. Many Venetians believe that a curse is attached to this jewel-like fifteenth-century palace, and it is hard to argue with the reports of strange diseases, ruined fortunes, suicides, and bizarre accidents that have befallen former residents. Yet the curse has not kept artists from portraying the striking asymmetrical fa√ßade, with its three floors of loggias and unique circular inlays. Cameron depicted the small palazzo twice and, as with all of his architectural scenes, he attempted to evoke the spirit and mysterious appeal of the edifice and it site on the Grand Canal.",
