  "text": "Ch'ing-pai (bluish-white) is an apt term for a thin, translucent glaze of a faint, bluish tone that deepens where it thickens or collects in intaglio designs. Ch'ing-pai porcelains are indigenous to southern China; Kiangsi province was the major source and it is likely that kilns in the vicinity of Ching-te-ch'en produced the greatest number and best quality.\r\n<P>This eight-paneled ewer is a fine example of Ch'ing-pai. The refined, delicacy of potting, subtle blue glaze, provide great aesthetic merit. An ewer of nearly identical size and shape was excavated from a Liao tomb in Chao-Yung city, Liaoning province, dated to about 1004.\r\n",
