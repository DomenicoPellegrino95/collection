  "text": "This extremely rare stand or censer is very similar to one excavated at the site of the early Ming imperial kilns at Ch'u-shan in Ching-te-chen, Kiangsu province and both are extraordinary examples of the magnificent \"sweet white\" porcelains produced during the reign of the Yung-lo emperor (1403-24). White ware held special significance for the emperor and it was the predominant color of Yung-lo court-sponsored wares. This imperial taste prompted changes in glaze and body constituents that resulted in this special type of \"sweet white\" ware whose sensuous surfaces are characteristically luminescent and silky.\r\n<P>Traditional Buddhist sculpture probably inspired this three-footed stand with its appliqu√©d lotus petal motifs arranged in throne-like fashion. Such powerful sculptural embellishment is rare in Yung-lo white porcelain which is more often delicately molded or incised.\r\n<P>Given the lotus symbolism seen here, it is likely this stand would have either supported a bowl for incense burning or served as a censer itself in an altar table decorated for Buddhist ritual.\r\n",
