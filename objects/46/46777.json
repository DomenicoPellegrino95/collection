  "text": "Devotional woodcuts are rare today because, ironically, they were such a common part of life in 15th-century Europe. Available by the thousands from peddlers at shrines and fairs, these mostly anonymous works were carried by pilgrims, tacked up for use as home altars, and sewn into clothing. Because they were so ordinary, they were not collected and preserved as fine art.  \r\n \r\nThis fine hand-colored example depicts Saint Veronica. According to legend, Veronica pitied Jesus as he carried his cross to Calvary and offered him her kerchief, or sudarium, which miraculously retained the imprint of Jesus’ face after she wiped his brow. The cloth presumed to have been Veronica’s — her name means vera icon, or “true image” — was kept as a holy relic at Saint Peter’s Basilica in Rome until the city was sacked in 1527.  The church granted indulgences, that is, less time in purgatory, to those who prayed before the relic, a benefit that extended to images of it. This made the veil a popular subject in religious art until the Reformation, when such practices came under criticism. ",
