  "text": "Wu-i Mountain in Fujian province, southern China was celebrated for its elegant landscape whose peaks and ridges were believed to be the retreats of celestial beings. It became a favorite place of Chinese literati who contributed a large corpus of writing in praise of this area. The present eight volume book was written by Tung Tian-kung in 1751 and was based on four previous works. The woodblocks were carved in 1846 by the \r\n<I>Wu-fu chi-mu</I> Studio and this copy was printed in 1872.\r\n\r\n<P>The book begins with thirty-two portraits of virtuous local people, scholars and immortals. The text provides a description of the mountains, a discussion of religious personages, ancient sites and literature connected with the area. There are ten maps, one for each mountain range, and architectural sketches.\r\n",
