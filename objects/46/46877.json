  "text": "In a mountainous setting dominated by a venerable pine, five old men gather around a painting of Shou-lao, the god of immortality. The inscription on the painting provides the reason for this choice of subject matter. It reads: <I>During the eighth lunar month of the year, 1653, painted to wish old Kuei prosperity and longevity on his fiftieth birthday. Hsi t'sun (West Village), Yu Ling.<I>\r\n<P>Virtually everything in the painting carries Taoist connotations of longevity, including the pine and rocks, the medicinal fungus tied to the walking staff, the rhinoceros horn cup, and the double gourd held by two of the men containing no doubt the elixir of immortality. Within the painting being viewed, Shou-lao, Immortal of the Southern Pole, is accompanied by cranes, pine, and deer, all standard metaphors for long life.\r\n<P>The style of Yu Ling's painting is that of the Che school of artists that flourished in the Chekiang city of Hangchou during much of Ming. Not surprisingly, Yu Ling is recorded as having spent most of his career working in that same city.",
