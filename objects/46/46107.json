  "text": "Rosenquist was strongly influenced by the large scale, bright colors, and simple forms of outdoor billboard advertising. In this early color lithograph, he depicts a severed telephone cable, a subject that apparently fascinated him and may have functioned as a metaphor for failed communication. When he was asked about his billboard work, Rosenquist replied that his intention is \"â€¦to get as far away from nature as possible.\" An oil painting of the same subject (dated 1970) is in the permanent collection of the Walker Art Center.",
