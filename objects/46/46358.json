  "text": "The aesthetic and introspective atmosphere of both the Northern and Southern Sung (1127-1279) dynasties is reflected in the quiet elegance of the classic forms and pure glazes that defined this golden age of ceramic production.\r\n<P>The greyish-bodied porcelaneous stonewares of the T'ung-ch'uan district in Shansi province were generically known as Yao-chou northern celadon. These vessels were usually decorated with bold designs under thin, translucent, deep olive green glazes. The decoration may be incised, as the case is here, mold-impressed, combed or applied relief. The glaze, which derives its color from iron, accumulates in the recessed areas intensifying the tone and emphasizing the pattern.\r\n<P>This bowl is freely carved on the interior with a design of three large peony blossoms with combed detailing on the petals and leaves.\r\n",
