  "text": "Muhammad spoke in his native Arabic when repeating divine messages he had received, so the Koran has always been written and recited in that language. Because of its special status, Arabic writing became a major art form and is often evident in ceramics. The interior of this exceptionally large and well-preserved Kashan dish is decorated with an elegant Arabic verse: \"La Ela Elah ha\" (\"The Lord our God, the one and only\"). During the Seljuk period, innovative Kashan workshops produced a variety of luster, underglaze-decorated, and monochrome wares. Chemical changes in the glaze resulting from centuries of burial gave this striking work a heavy iridescence.",
