  "text": "Monumental, twelve-panel screens became fashionable during the Kangxi reign (1662-1722) when they served as backdrops for formal gatherings. Each of the hinged panels framed a painting or calligraphy. In this example, the panoramic scene depicts a son's (capping) ceremony taking place at an aristocratic villa. The open carving is finely finished on both sides, a rarity on large screens. Each of the upper and lower wood panels display hornless dragons surrounding a medallion with stylized <I>shou<I> (longevity) characters. Taihu rocks dot the landscaped garden. This scene confirms the long-standing appreciation for rocks among scholar-officials and aesthetes in China, particularly in the Song dynasty (960-1279 AD), when rocks made their way into the intimate setting of the scholar's studio and private gardens.",
