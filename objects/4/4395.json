  "text": "Throughout the 19th century, American and European manufacturers alike produced wares emblazoned with images of George Washington (1732-99), the first American icon.  Washington's qualities of fortitude, judgment, and sense of duty made him a constant inspiration to Americans, although the media and methods used to portray him changed and developed.  Bohemian glassmakers tapped into the market for Washingtoniana with this brilliantly colored glass goblet decorated with Gothic revival trefolis and an engraved portrait based on a printed design.  Expensive to produce, this goblet in an example of encasing clear glass within a layer of colored glass and then cutting the colored layer to create a highly reflective surface.",
