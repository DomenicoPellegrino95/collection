  "text": "The beadwork on this contemporary baby bonnet was done in a pictographic style that is associated with the Cheyenne River Reservation in the 19th century.  On one side of the bonnet a young man, wearing his courting blanket, fan, and leading horses, is shown.  He is bringing the horses as a gift to a young lady that was beaded on the other side of the bonnet.  She is shown as though she has finished her domestic chores and is awaiting his arrival; near her is a bucket and a rack of meat drying.\r\n\r\n",
