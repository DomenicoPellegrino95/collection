  "text": "This finely detailed pleasure boat of white jade is carved in perfect unison with its rosewood base, which describes the water flowers and aquatic birds of the lotus pond on which the craft is meant to be sail. The great pleasure gardens of the Qing dynasty, such as the Summer Palace in Beijing, included extensive planted water courses that accommodated the boating parties of the aristocracy. This exquisite carving shows a group of boaters complete with potted plants and wicker picnic boxes. With its aristocratic theme, flawless white stone and superb craftsmanship, it epitomizes eighteenth century decorative tastes.",
