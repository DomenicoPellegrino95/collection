  "text": "Karl Krenek created a number of designs that were produced by the Wiener Werkstätte in the second decade of the 20th century. Known primarily for his woodblock prints, his textile designs often reflect the power of line imagery. His best-known textile works are printed fabrics, but he also produced designs for brocaded woven fabrics. This tapestry is attributed to Karl Krenek on the basis of design style and the presence of the boxed initials \"KK\" in the lower left hand corner of the textile. <P>\r\nThe name of the tapestry workshop, probably indicated by the boxed initials \"PSI,\" and its location remains a mystery. Although most of the Wiener Werkstätte artists's works were made in Vienna, some textile designs were produced in other parts of Europe. This tapestry is woven in an unusual technique which is not associated with Vienna and it is therefore likely that it was produced somewhere in Eastern Europe, where this weaving technique was more commonly used.\r\n\r\n",
