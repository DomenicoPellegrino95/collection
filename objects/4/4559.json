  "text": "Although it derives in taste and somewhat in technique from the opulently inlaid metalwork of Egypt, Syria, and Iran before the fifteenth century, Bidri ware is uniquely Indian. The base metal is an alloy of zinc, copper, lead, and tin exquisitely inlaid with brass or silver. After the inlay was applied, the object was bathed in acid; this turned the background a rich black, providing a beautiful contrast to the more precious inlaid metal.\r\n<P>The Muslim sultans of the Deccan region (14th-17th centuries) were the major patrons of this craft, which was manufactured at the capital of Bidar'hence, the name Bidri.",
