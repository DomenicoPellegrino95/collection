  "text": "In the \"Easy Edges\" furniture series, Gehry experimented with atypical materials to create dining tables, biomorphic chairs and stools, and lounge chairs, all made of corrugated cardboard. To increase the strength and resilience of the material, layers of cardboard were laminated at right angles to one another. Originally conceived as low-cost furniture, \"Easy Edges\" was so immediately successful that Gehry withdrew the series from production after only three months, fearing his ascendancy as a popular furniture designer would detract from his potential as an architect. The architect revisited the cardboard concept in 1990 for Vitra, a Swiss furniture manufacturer, who reissued the \"Wiggle\" chair in a variety of colors, along with other furnishings designed by Gehry.",
