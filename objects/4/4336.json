  "text": "This white tripod is of the highest standard in terms of pure color. White seems to have been the prized color in jade throughout Chinese history, but it reached a height in popularity during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This vessel has an exceptionally luminescent quality, and in view of this its maker has taken care not to clutter the form with detailed ornament, but rather provide a simple, polished surface that under strong light is totally dazzling. The tripod shape here is a vague reference to the ancient ceremonial bronzes of early Chou. This form, originally used in ancestor rites, was eventually revived and simplified to be used as Buddhist censers during the later dynasties of Ming and Ch'ing. Like the other magnificent jade burners in the Walker collection, however, this object was mainly cherished for the innate beauty of the stone itself.",
