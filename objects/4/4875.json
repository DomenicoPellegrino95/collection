  "text": "Tall vases with rilled necks and simple phoenix heads positioned under a flared mouth have been excavated from Liao territory in north China. This type, however, with its relatively strong modeling, long neck, and squat ewer form is associated with Kuang-tung province in extreme south China. The hard bodied, creamy-white glazed ware often incorporated incised or modeled ornamentation of an exotic bird. The unperforated beak of the bird does not act as a spout, suggesting that the vessel may have functioned as a vase rather than a ewer or possibly it was intended only as a non-functional bural vessel simulating the shape of a ewer.",
