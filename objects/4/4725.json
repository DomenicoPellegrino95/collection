  "text": "Jean Puiforcat rejuvenated silver design worldwide with elegant forms that appear even more luxurious for their lack of embellishment.  This coffee and tea service is a supreme example - the elements are completely devoid of traditional silver decoration.  The optical glass handles are not only arresting, they reflect the silver's sleek surface.  Today, this service is widely regarded as an icon of modernity, simultaneously austere and sumptuous.",
