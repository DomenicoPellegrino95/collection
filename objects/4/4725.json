  "text": "The components of this coffee and tea service seem to float like ships through water. Because they have attached bases, an old-fashioned tray was not necessary. The optical glass handles—an impractical but very modern touch—reflect the silver’s sleek surface. The electric hot water kettle, the largest piece in the set, was another innovation. The set also includes, in order of size, a coffeepot, teapot, sugar bowl, and creamer.  ",
