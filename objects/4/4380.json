  "text": "These bulbous earrings may appear abstract, but they actually emulate the shape of a snake.  The jeweler used a variety of geometric shapes to form two eyes, a hood and rearing torso, and even a long nose and forked tongue.  Snakes are simultaneously revered and feared in India, and are believed to be portents of fortune and fertility. Women in Tamil Nadu, southeastern India, wore this traditional design in distended earlobes, a practice which 19th century European missionaries to India disdained.  While wearing these adornments is less common today, they still signal material wealth and confer prosperity upon their wearer.  ",
