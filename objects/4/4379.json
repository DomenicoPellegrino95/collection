  "text": "This fabulous necklace once adorned the neck of a Brahmin priest or wealthy Chettiar (a male member of a mercantile community with roots in Tamil Nadu), who would have worn it on very special occasions.  Its chain is made of Rudraksha beads from a tree believed to be sacred to Shiva, which is attached to three golden lozenges decorated with rubies and semiprecious stones.  The central amulet depicts the divine couple, Shiva and Parvati, flanked by their two sons, Ganesha and Murugan.  A goddess related to Murugan named Kaumari appears on the clasp.  The bottom amulet opens, and would have contained a lingam or sacred ash, allowing it to function as a portable shrine.",
