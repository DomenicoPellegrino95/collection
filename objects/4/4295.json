  "text": "This spectacularly decorated man's cape would have have been part of an ensemble of beaded clothing, made by an Anishinabe woman for a male relative to wear on special occasions such as social and religious events.  Anishinabe women were known for their skill at beadwork and textile ornamentation.  The floral designs here are typical of their work, while the mirrors add an extra element of shine and color.  The rich and extensive decoration added to the value of the cape and prestige of its wearer.",
