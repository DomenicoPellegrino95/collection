  "text": "The first modern industrial designer, Christopher Dresser worked with a number of different British manufacturers of furniture, metalwork, wallpaper, ceramics and glass to create well-designed yet mass produced objects.  For the Scottish company James Couper and Sons he designed a line of hand-blown glass produced with industrial techniques.  The line was called <i>Clutha,</i> meaning “cloudy” in Gaelic, by the London retailer Liberty’s.  These deliberately bubbly and streaked glass vases and bottles were produced in a range of tertiary colors suitable to the mid and late nineteenth century British interior: greeny yellow, amber, lilac and turquoise.  Metallic streaks were added to the glass to create jewel-like qualities imitative of Roman and Venetian glass.  \r\n\r\nDresser, a botanist by training, but also an inveterate world traveler studied ceramics and glass from all cultures.  The Clutha bottles and vases were inspired by Japanese, Persian and Indian water-sprinklers he saw at the South Kensington Museum in London (now the Victoria and Albert Museum).",
