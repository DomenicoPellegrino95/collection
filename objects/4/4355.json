  "text": "This piebald stallion was so important to its owner that he hired the most famous artist around to paint its portrait.  The artist’s name was Bhavanidas and the horse’s was Jugaldan, the Iraqi steed, which we know from the Persian and Devanagari inscriptions at the top of the painting. It is unusual for paintings to record this type of information, which makes our painting rare and valuable. Bhavanidas worked in both Mughal and Kishangarh courts, and in the latter location horse portraiture was a highly developed genre. These splendid animals were among the most prized possessions of royalty, who imported them through Arabian trade routes.",
