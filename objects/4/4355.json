  "text": "An inscription in Nagari and Persian script at the top of this rare signed folio reads: “The horse Jukaldan Ayragi with tenacious face belonging to the realm.” The painting is further inscribed in Persian script in the upper-left corner: “amal-i musawir bhavani das” (“work of the painter Bhavani Das”). Records show that Bhavani Das was enticed in 1719 from the Mughal court in Agra to work for Maharajah Raj Singh (1706–48) in Kishangarh, where he became the most highly paid of all employees in that state. Bhavani Das thus provides a clear artistic link between a Rajput court and the Mughal ateliers.\r\n\r\nIndeed, this elegant equine portrait is an early example of a pictorial style favored by the Kishangarh princes that was similar to a type of animal study popular at the Mughal court at the same time. In this depiction of a piebald stallion, Bhavani Das displays the drafting skill and refined attention to head and outline that made his horse paintings popular.",
