  "text": "This exquisite vase consists of a large lotus flower delicately supported by stems and leaves carved in the full round. As with many jade objects of this era, the wooden stand relates both in theme and style to the stone it supports. This work vividly demonstrates the technical virtuosity and artistry achieved in jade carving during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. As more showy, brightly colored jadeite was imported from Burma, a penchant for elaborately worked carvings developed. Despite the incredible hardness of jade and the enormous patience required to fashion it, the maker of this piece has created a delicate rhythm of plant forms with flawless artistry.",
  "description": "A large deeply hollowed lotus leaf supported by an elaborate openwork base of stems and leaves pierced and carved in the round, the cover with a lotus pod, blossom and two birds; the cover is tacky waxed to the base and may come loose.",
