  "text": "Pumpkins and other squash were staple crops of ancient Mexico. Some of the world's earliest containers for storing and serving food and drink were hollow, dried gourds, so this in this ceramic pumpkin vessel art imitates life. The deep orange, symmetrical body of the pot perches on three feet in the form of parrots, prized for their feathers. Parrots and pumpkins were both associated with fertility and abundance in ancient Colima.",
