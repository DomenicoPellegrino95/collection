  "text": "This leaf is from a now dispersed manuscript of the Gandavyu_ha, one of the most important and popular texts of Mahayana Buddhism in Nepal. It expounds the Buddhist doctine by narrating the spiritual experiences of a youth named Sudhana in his quest for enlightenment. The illustration on this page shows Sudhana near a fig tree enroute to meet his guru.  The background of the composition is filled with tiny black dots to create a pointillist effect.  It is likely that these dots represent rain or a night scene.\r\nThis illuminated folio constitutes the earliest form of South Asian painting in the collection. Painted on palm leaf, it predates the introduction from China to India. No illuminated manuscript from East India or Nepal can be securely dated before the eleventh century and it is likely that the tradition originated in the Buddhist monasteries of Bengal and Bihar in eastern India. The Nepali mnuscript to which this leaf once belonged is the only known illustrated example of the <i>Gandavyuha<i> from South Asia.",
