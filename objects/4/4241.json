  "text": "The Ancient Puebloans (Anasazi) settled in small villages of pit-houses or pueblos that accommodated one or two extended family groups.  An exception to this settlement pattern arose at the end of the 10th century when a huge complex of pueblos was built at Chaco Canyon, which became the center of Ancient Puebloan civilization.  Similar small-scale adobe complexes sprung up at Canyon de Chelly and Mesa Verde, but in the 13th and 14th centuries, the inhabitants were forced to abandon their homes, possibly due to drought.  Their descendents, who live in today's Pueblo villages, find inspiration in the remnants of their ancestors' pottery.  The bold black and white geometric designs remain a popular style amongst contemporary Pueblo potters.",
