  "text": "This rare storage vessel was found in a cave in the Kalong district of northern Thailand late in 1990. There were a total of seventeen vessels in the find, including eight large, well-potted celadon glaze jars with stamped decor similar to this one. Few Thai jars of this size and quality have survived and few have been found at other sites. It is possible that the group was a special commission and were probably produced at the Phayao or Sankampang kilns in northern Thailand.",
