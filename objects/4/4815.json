  "text": "Painted by P'an at the age of eighty-seven, this impressionistic rendering of a mist-shrouded temple compound is done in the wet ink style of the great Sung artist, Mi Fei (1052-1107). Above the foreground trees and diminutive structures, are layer upon layer of mountain ranges with bands of mist rising from the valleys. At the top of the painting, P'an has copied inscriptions by earlier literati artists including Wang Hui (1632-1717), Yun Shou-ping (1633-1690), Cha Shih-piao (1615-1698) and Tan Chung-kuang (1623-1692). In effect, P'an is placing himself within an exalted lineage of former literati artists, including Mi Fei, one of China's greatest scholars and innovative artists. \r\n<P>This lyrical mid-nineteenth century work is a testament to the enduring nature of the ink landscape. For over 1200 years Chinese artists have kept this vital by reinterpreting historical models while creating personal styles of brushwork and compositional arrangements.",
