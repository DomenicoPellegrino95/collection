  "text": "Important pieces of jade traditionally were fitted with display stands when they were made. Here, realistic lotus blossoms and pods of white jade combine harmoniously with their green, leafy support of carved and tinted ivory. The green jade frog stopper adds a bit of humor to the total composition. The lotus, although long a Buddhist symbol of spiritual purity, is exploited here for its decorative potential. The carving reflects the late eighteenth and nineteenth century aristocratic taste for realistically carved subject matter and pure, bright colors. The combination of jade with other precious material such as ivory, gold or other hardstones became increasingly popular as the nineteenth century progressed and collectors vied to display their wealth.",
