  "text": "Both commercial and handspun yarns were used to create this stunning Third Phase child's blanket. The bold red, white, and indigo motifs reference both the man’s and woman’s Third Phase blankets in that terraced diamonds and triangles merge with the traditional placement of horizontal stripes. The innovative use of salmon-colored trade yarn works to further expand upon Diné traditions and help pave the way for more daring experiments with color.",
