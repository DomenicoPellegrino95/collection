  "text": "Family farms flourished when massive segments of the native prairie were converted from grass to tilled cropland across the American Midwest, but instability was also written into the landscape.\r\n \r\nPrairie soils are dark and full of nutrients, supporting vast root systems that penetrate deep and stabilize the ground. The roots provide nitrogen, carbon, phosphorus, and microbial activity that facilitate rapid decomposition and the accumulation of organic matter. This formula creates beautiful, fertile soilâ€”perfect for the hopeful farmers who sought to sink their dreams into it. When these prairies are ripped up the bare soils are exposed to wind and water erosion. Without the stabilizing root system heavy rains wash away the topsoil and it becomes less and less productive. During the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s, severe drought and wind sent powdered dirt into the air, creating black outs, killing the once-mighty American Breadbasket. \r\n \r\nMonolith\r\n\r\nThis soil is taken from Western Minnesota prairie near Fergus Falls, MN. It is a Mollisol that formed under native grasses in the Prairie Pothole region and is 10,000 to 12,000 years old.",
