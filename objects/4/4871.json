  "text": "The form of scepter called <I>ju-i<I> (meaning \"as desired\" or as \"you wish\") is an ancient auspicious symbol that became the mark of a cultivated gentleman. It may have originated as a weapon or as a Buddhist implement, but old paintings often depict scholars holding <I>ju-i<I> scepters while engaged in conversation. By the Ming period those done in \"organic taste\" like this one were common literati accoutrements and they were often given as gifts.\r\n<P>Carved from boxwood in imitation of rootwood, with <I>ju-i<I> heads, this scepter is a classic example of the Chinese scholar's love of natural forms. The reverse side bears a carved poem along the shaft which reads as follows:\r\n<P><I>Crows gather in the tree-lined alley,<I>\r\n<P>bestowed by imperial order, seated for tea.<I>\r\n<P>Returning to the Jade Hall feeling refreshed.<I>\r\n<P>A new crescent moon shines over<I>\r\n<P>branches of thorn ferns.<I>",
