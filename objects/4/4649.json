But it came from a well-designed summer house for the Decker family near Lake Minnetonka, where its humble pine and durable horsehair—once deep blue, now faded—were considered appropriate for a relaxing retreat. Purcell noted, “Mr. Decker spent all the money that was necessary to make our architectural thesis complete in all its detail.”",
