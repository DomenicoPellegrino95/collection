  "text": "Based upon a chalk drawing by the Italian Renaissance artist Michelangelo (1475-1564), this terra cotta sculpture depicts Leda, the ancient Queen of Sparta, being seduced by the Greek god Zeus in the guise of a swan. The French sculptor Albert Ernest Carrier-Belleuse chose this mythological subject to embody the sensuality of the human form and evoke the artistic traditions of the great Renaissance masters.",
