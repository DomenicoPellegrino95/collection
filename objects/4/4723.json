  "text": "Huang-hua-li, the expensive Southeast Asian hardwood from which much Ming style furniture is constructed, is so dense that boring insects cannot penetrate it. Its hardness also makes the intricate interlocking joinery on which it is based possible. Although the wood will dry and discolor with time, it is extremely durable and readily restored with light cleaning and the application of heavy wax.\r\n\r\nThe interior of this cabinet is typical in that the shelving and back have been made of less expensive softwoods. The interior still has its original red lacquer coating which appears more dirty and worn than the resilient, well-polished hardwood exterior.",
