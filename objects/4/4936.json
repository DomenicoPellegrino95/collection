  "text": "The shape of this tripodal vessel, called <I>ch√ºeh</I>, derives from ancient Shang dynasty (12th-11th century BCE) ritual bronzes. Those bronzes were used for the ceremonial heating and drinking of wine. But this cup and stand probably served as a small water container or brush washer. Although blue-and-white porcelain is more decorative than \"organic taste\" scholar's objects, the reference here to China's antiquity and illustrious Bronze Age would have made this piece acceptable to 18th-century literati.",
