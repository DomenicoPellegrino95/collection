  "text": "Arthur Amiotte is a well-respected Lakota artist who has worked in many genres. Like much of his work, this collage draws on Lakota history and his own family heritage. This collage reuses turn-of-the-century tobacco advertising and packaging, engravings, family photos and text to create a commentary on the white appropriation and misuse of Native American culture. Amiotte's great-grandfather, Standing Bear, appears in the lower left corner, seemingly sitting on labels from Durham Bull tobacco pouches. Standing Bear was a member of Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, which toured Europe and performed before Queen Victoria, who appears multiple times in the  opposite corner.  She, in turn, is connected to her consort, Prince Albert, who provides the link to tobacco. The large central image reproduces a painting of Chief Joseph, again taken from advertising. In the upper right corner is a photo of Amiotte's grandfather, George Mestith. Beside him, on paper replicating that of ledger books, is a wry commentary by Amiotte. Images that further reference ledger drawings frame the left side of the composition. ",
