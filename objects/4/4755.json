  "text": "The central scene of this plate, derived from a European engraving, depicts the Judgment of Paris, when King Priam's son is asked to decide who is the most beautiful of three Greek goddesses, Aphrodite, Hera and Athena. Paris is shown handing the apple to Aphrodite. This is probably the most popular European design on Chinese porcelain during the 1740s. As a number of border decorations were used, it is apparent that this pattern was available at a number of different Chinese workshops between the 1740s and 1755.",
