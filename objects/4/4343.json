  "text": "This pillow is carved in the form of a crouching boy holding a bird in his left hand. Hard pillows, usually made of ceramic, were common in China and several pottery examples in the form of children have survived from Sung times (960-1280). Pillows of jade, however,  are extremely rare, and given the precious nature of the material, this piece probably was a decorative object intended for display rather than use. Children are auspicious to the Chinese, and they figure prominently in the artistic motifs of Sung ceramics, as well as in the carved lacquer, paintings and textiles of the following dynasties. National holidays for both boys and girls are still celebrated in the Far East and the subject matter of this jade pillow, however strange to Western eyes, reflects a long-standing cultural value.",
