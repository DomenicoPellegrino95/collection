  "text": "Born into an important family in Hangchou, Ch'ien Tu was brought up on the literary classics. He was also able to study directly from ancient paintings and calligraphy in his father's study. This painting of a scholar in a boat drifting past a rocky outcropping illustrates one of the most famous Sung dynasty poems: Su Shih's (1037-1101) \"Meditations on Red Cliff.\" The artist has included the entire verse in this small scroll; it reads in part:\r\n\r\n<P><I>The great river flowing ever eastward, <I>\r\n<P><I>Its waves have washed away all the gallants of ancient times. . .<I>\r\n<P><I>Riotous rocks cleave the clouds;<I>\r\n<P><I>Roaring billows rend the shores. . .<I>\r\n<P><I>My hair turning grey in these early years<I>\r\n<P><I>Life is but a dream<I>\r\n<P><I>Let us pour a goblet of wine to the river moon.<I>\r\n\r\n<P>While Ch'ien Tu often created complex compositions, his brushwork was typically carefully executed, detailed, and exacting. Although the theme here is literary, the meticulous rendering and use of color would have likely appealed more to the merchant than the scholarly class.",
