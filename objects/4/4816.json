  "text": "Born into an important family in Hangchou, Qian Du was brought up on the literary classics. He was also able to study directly from ancient paintings and calligraphy in his father's study. This painting of a scholar in a boat drifting past a rocky outcropping illustrates one of the most famous Sung dynasty poems: Su Shi's (1037-1101) \"Meditations on Red Cliff.\" The artist has included the entire verse in this small scroll; it reads in part:\r\n<I>The great river flowing ever eastward, \r\nIts waves have washed away all the gallants of ancient times. . .\r\nRiotous rocks cleave the clouds;\r\nRoaring billows rend the shores. . .\r\nMy hair turning grey in these early years\r\nLife is but a dream\r\nLet us pour a goblet of wine to the river moon</I>\r\nWhile Qian Du often created complex compositions, his brushwork was typically carefully executed, detailed, and exacting. Although the theme here is literary, the meticulous rendering and use of color would have likely appealed more to the merchant than the scholarly class.",
