  "text": "Throughout his career, Rodin created sculptures of the fragmented human body. He had an extraordinary ability to employ the power of gesture to convey deep emotions and used his skill to express these gestures in sculpture. Rodin had a lifelong fascination with cathedrals, and the shape of the converging hands here alludes to the pointed arches of a Gothic church. Besides expressing calmness, faith and protection, it is interesting that the linked hands presumably come from different bodies. \r\n",
