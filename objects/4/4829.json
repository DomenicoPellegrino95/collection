  "text": "This folio is from a manuscript made for an elite patron in the Deccan region of south India.  It illustrates a story about the trials and tribulations of lovers, a metaphor for divine love. At the center of this painting, we see one of its characters, King Raja Bikram, who sits underneath a tree in a beautiful garden. Bikram and his wife are unable to conceive a child, and thus he has embarked on a spiritual journey to find a solution. Wearing the humble outfit of a wandering mendicant, he has spied seven fairies bathing in a fountain.  He steals their clothes and holds them in a large bag, which he ransoms in order to enlist the fairiesâ€™ help. The fairies gesticulate wildly for their clothes, and agree to help Bikram find a holy man, from whom he eventually obtains a fruit that allows his wife to bear a son. ",
