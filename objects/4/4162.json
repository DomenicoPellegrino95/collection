  "text": "Kay Sekimachi was already a groundbreaking fiber artist and weaver, having studied with creative fiber artists Trude Guermonprez and Jack Lenor Larsen, when she married wood turner Bob Stocksdale in 1972.  By that time, she had been weaving sculptural woven monofilament forms that gracefully helped define the possibilities of three-dimensional fiber art.  With her <I>Paper Bowl<I> of 1987, Sekimachi combined pieces of translucent handmade paper, embedded with linen thread, to make an ethereal version of a functional object. Sekimachi also collaborated on \"Marriage of Form\" sets with Stocksdale, where she constructed delicate wasp-nest fiber vessels using her husband's elegant turned wood bowl as a form. ",
