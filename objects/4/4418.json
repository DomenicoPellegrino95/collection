  "text": "Painted in the last year of Metsu's life, this exquisitely preserved panel reveals the elegant and ornate style that he was developing in response to trends in contemporary Dutch portraiture at mid-century. The woman has been identified as Lucia Wijbrants, the daughter of a silk merchant, and the wealthy second wife of Jan Hinlopen, an Amsterdam cloth merchant and real estate developer. According to Lucia's will dated June 27, 1716, she bequeathed the family silver (which is displayed prominently in this painting), to her two stepdaughters from Hinlopen's first marriage, whose family portrait hangs in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.",

She has a book in one hand and holds up her skirt with the other. She wears a light blue satin dress embroidered with gold lace. On the table, which is covered with a Turkey carpet, are a mirror, a silver box, and a candlestick. A spaniel frisks at her feet.",
