  "text": "The Chinese have played <I>wei-ch'i<I>, or <I>go<I>, since ancient times and it is first mentioned in the Confucian classics of the fifth century B.C. Both men and women of the educated class played <I>wei-ch'i<I> and to the literati, it became a symbol of the intellect. This <I>huang-hua-li<I> board is framed in <I>ji-chi-mu<I> hardwood and inlaid with silver. One side is a board for <I>wei-ch'i<I>, while the reverse is a board for chess, or <I>hsiang-ch'i<I> or elephant chess. The fluted bowls, used to hold the stone <I>wei-ch'i<I> markers are also made of <I>huang-hua-li<I> wood. They are fashioned in the shape of a melon and the round lids are carved with an eight-pointed star pattern. These containers are generally made in a size that can be easily held in the palm of the hand.  <I>Wei-ch'i<I> markers during Ch'ing were generally made from stone or glass.",
