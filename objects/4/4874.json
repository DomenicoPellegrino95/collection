  "text": "These two footsoldiers accurately depict the military attire of the late Bronze Age and early Han period. One wears a chest protector of plate armor and both are attired in high boots and padded garments whose added bulk, especially the collars and sleeves, provided a barrier to arrows and other weapons. The hands of each soldier extend to grasp weapons now missing and the tunic of one displays colorful ribbons which may have indicated his rank.",
