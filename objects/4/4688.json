  "text": "A plane overhead doesn’t attract much attention anymore, but in 1910 it would have been a modern marvel. The bi-plane depicted in this window, set against a bright blue sky, symbolizes the exciting new technologies of the time and Purcell’s fascination with them. The design was inspired by a movie (also new and novel at the time) featuring aviator Glenn Curtis flying his bi-plane, and was one of a series of windows created for the Stricker home—another is on view in this gallery.
