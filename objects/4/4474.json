  "text": "Jaune Quick-To-See Smith is an important Native American contemporary artist who marries traditional and present day styles in her work.  In Sources of Strength, Smith is referencing cultural symbols that she finds meaningful.  Some, like the Thunderbird and bear on the left, are depicted in petroglyph form.  Others on the right are shown in a more modern style.  Tying the whole painting together are strong zigzag lines, which recall familiar lines used in historical Plains Indian art to depict lightning, thunder, and spiritual power.  By combining the imagery of historical Native American beliefs with more current symbols, Jaune Quick-To-See Smith brings traditional art into the present.",
