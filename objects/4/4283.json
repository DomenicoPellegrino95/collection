  "text": "For many Islamic cultures calligraphy is a particularly admired art form, especially appreciated because it often relates to religious texts. For centuries considerable stylization of the Arabic script has taken place to conform with the aesthetic conventions of a given period. Individual artists have taken considerable license with alphabetic forms and included these elements in the design and decoration of many objects. During the last half of the 20th century both woven and embroidered wall panels such as this piece often hung on the walls of Moroccan homes not only as a decorative element, but also as an indication of piety.",
