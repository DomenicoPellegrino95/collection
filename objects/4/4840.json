  "text": "Stools preceded chairs in the evolution of raised seating. Paintings indicate that by T'ang (618-906), a variety of stools were in use. Square and round shapes prevailed and those made for the aristocracy could be elaborately constructed with cabriole legs, shaped seats, and decorative carving. This corner-leg or \"waisted\" stool represents one of the most popular styles during the late Ming period. The waist and apron of this stool are formed from a single piece of wood for greater strength. The high hoof feet here are indicators of an early Ch'ing date for this piece.",
