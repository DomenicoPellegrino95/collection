  "text": "Beattan Yazz is known for both his famous children's book illustrations as well as for his award-winning paintings.  Yazz incorporates both Indian and non-Indian influences in his work in order to produce a unique style of his own.  The Dine of the southwest, commonly known as Navajo, were agriculturists.  In addition to cultivating corn, beans, melon, and cotton, the Dine also hunted.  In order to be successful hunters, the Dine may have used feathers to aid them in their pursuit.   Many Native groups respected birds for their agility, swiftness, and beauty.  By incorporating the feathers in their celebrations, the feathers would hopefully bring these admirable characteristics to the dancer.  Feathers were also used as colorful decorations and adornments.",
