  "text": "Although widely used by both genders, the so-called \"rose chair\" because of its small size and evocative name has traditionally been associated with women and the women's quarters. Comprised of slender sections of huang-hua-li, this petite armchair evokes a delicacy that does in fact have feminine overtones.\r\n<P>The latticework designs filling the back and arm sections are comprised of addorsed and linked <I>ju-i<I> heads (the wish granting scepter) and cloud scrolls. Carved <I>ling-chih<I> fungus (the fungus of immortality) comprise the wooden struts between the stretchers and seat rails. The metal reinforcing mounts, required to reinforce several of the chair's delicate joints are original.",
