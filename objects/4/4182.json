  "text": "Maher designed several rugs for Rockledge, the home of E.L. King in Homer, Minnesota,  all woven in geometric patterns to complement the architecture. Placed throughout the house, they helped unify the interior. This runner has the same geometric border and color palette as the other rugs but lacks their central geometric jacquard pattern.",
