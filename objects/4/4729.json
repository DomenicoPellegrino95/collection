  "text": "This small handscroll is a classic example of literati values. Affixed colophons and collector's seals add to the value of the original work and establish its pedigree. The small painting, in fact, is almost incidental to the whole. The artist notes in a short inscription that he modeled his landscape after two ancient masters by combining the \"wet\" style of Mi Fei (1051-1107) and the \"dry\" style of Ni Zan (1301-1374). The \"wet\" and \"dry\" styles originated by Mi Fei and Ni Zan were standard avenues of study for most literati artists. In this case, the combination of the two in a single work would have intrigued Dong Qichang who was arguably the most influential literati artist, calligrapher and critic of the seventeenth century.",
