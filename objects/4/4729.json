  "text": "This is a relatively small example of a handscroll, painted by the scholar-official Cha Shibiao.  Painting for a scholar-official was an activity of personal enjoyment, not economic gain.  Unlike professional painters who depended on commissions, scholar-officials, or literati, were their own patrons.  Handscrolls such as this one were to be viewed by one or two people at a time, and the scroll reads from right to left.\r\n\r\nCha Shibiao begins his painting with a mountain form done in subtle tonalities.  His very wet application of ink is reminiscent of the painter Mi Fei, a Song dynasty painter. Elsewhere, Cha Shibiao uses a contrasting dry style of ink application, as in the trees, paying homage to Ni Zan, a famous painter from the Yuan dynasty (1301-74). The large red seal on the right side belonged to Song Luo, a famous official and collector.\r\n\r\nTypical of many literati paintings, a great deal of attention has been paid to the written word.  There are over a dozen colophons-or identifying inscriptions-attached to this small painting, providing a great deal of visual analysis, criticism, and collecting history.  \r\n",
