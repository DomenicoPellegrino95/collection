  "text": "The zither, or <I>ch'in<I>, has been regarded as a symbol of enlightenment by the Chinese since Confucian times (6th century b.c.). By the seventeenth century, it was a required object in most scholars' studies, if only for display. This rare example has inscriptions on the bottom, including the title <I>Chung Ho<I> (\"middle harmony\") and the number 57. One of a series made in 1634 for Prince Lu, a son of the Wan-li emperor, it was probably given as a gift to a friend or member of his aristocratic literary circle. The instrument also bears the gilded mark <I>Lu-kuo shih ch'uan<I> (\"heirloom of the Lu State\") and an engraved poem, signed by Ching-i chu-jen, that reads:\r\n<BR>\r\n<P><I>The moonlight is reflected in the Yangtze;\r\n<P>A light breeze blows over clear dew drops.\r\n<P>Only in a tranquil place\r\n<P>Can one comprehend the feeling of eternity.<I>\r\n<BR>\r\n<P>Apparently, scholars liked having a variety of inscriptions and seals affixed to an otherwise utilitarian object.",
