  "text": "This slender roundback armchair exhibits extensively carved aprons and backsplat. While the flower vase decorating the backsplat is unusual, at least three other chairs are known that bear nearly identical carved d√©cor suggesting that these chairs once belonged to a larger set.<p>Roundback armchairs, like tall yokeback armchairs, were used in more formal seating arrangements and were reserved for use by the highest ranking members of a household. The shortback armchair and side chair shown to either side of this chair for instance were commonly used on informal occasions or by persons of lesser rank in a formal gathering.",
