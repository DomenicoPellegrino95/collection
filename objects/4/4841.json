  "text": "This deskâ€™s Indian makers used British pattern books as a guide. These forms suited their elite British market, including colonial officials. \r\nIt incorporates local materials that were plentiful to Indian craftsmen in the 18th-century, but today they are scarce. The ebony for the stand, once abundant in southern India, is now endangered, while the rosewood of the desk is now threatened. Elephant ivory, now endangered, was in widespread use for architectural woodwork decoration in southern India.",
