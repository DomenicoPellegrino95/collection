  "text": "The absurdity of the painter's bonnet is matched by the formidable powdered wigs of her subjects.  The macaroni wig epitomized the decadence and contrivances of 1770s fashion in England. Dighton exaggerates them and comically mocks one of the fellows who wears one by portraying him with crossed-eyes and pursed lips. This print was extremely successful and can be spotted in the print below by John Raphael Smith, where it is shown for sale in a print shop.",
