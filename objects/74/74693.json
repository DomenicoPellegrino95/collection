  "text": "These dandies may remind you of The Three Musketeers.  Indeed, Alexandre Dumas’s famous novel is set at precisely the time Jean de Saint Igny and Abraham Bosse collaborated on this series of fashion plates. If you wanted to fit in at the court of King Louis XIII, you needed a good supply of feathers and pompoms. You also had to make sure that your boots were loose enough to turn down. If you really wanted a place at the table, you were better off with a sword, muskets were for the lower classes of French nobility and for the younger sons of better families.",
