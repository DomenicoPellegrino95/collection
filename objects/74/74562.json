  "text": "Always proud of their drinking cups, Germans developed a new style in the late 16th century called Jungfrauenbecher, or maiden cups. These were fine silver cups shaped like women (or maidens), with generous embossed or chased skirts. The cups would stand rim-side-down when not in use. These woodcuts, from a costume book by Jost Amman, would have been typical sources of maiden cup designs; Amman worked closely with goldsmith Wenzel Jamnitzer, whose Nuremberg workshop invented these cups. The torn corner of one woodcut may have resulted from heavy use in a shop.",
