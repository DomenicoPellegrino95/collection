  "text": "Kerry James Marshall is widely recognized for his race-conscious art that challenges the historical exclusion of African Americans from the artistic canon. Vignette (Wishing Well), is thematically related to the artist’s long-running series of major “vignette” paintings that borrow freely from familiar art historical genres. Here, he invokes pictorial conventions of eighteenth-century French romantic painting, mimicking the formal visual device of a narrative illustration, but replacing the expected white figures with black figures. Marshall calls this tactic “foregrounding the black figure in popular genres of painting not usually associated with the socio-political frame in which much African American art is seen through.” In this, he seeks to expand the viewer’s understanding of art historical biases, while normalizing the presence of black subjects within the visual arts.",
