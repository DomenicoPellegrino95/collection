  "text": "The Infant Christ is characteristic of tapestries produced in the Southern Netherlands around 1500, which were small in size (typically less than six feet square) and dealt with Christian iconography, especially themes related to Christ’s crucifixion. This tapestry depicts the infant Christ pressing grapes into a chalice, a reference to the physical sacrifice he would later make for humanity, and which would be celebrated in the Eucharist. It is exceptional for its costly materials and refined techniques of manufacture. When compared to extant tapestries in museum collections, this example stands out as superior for its focused subject matter and streamlined design.",
