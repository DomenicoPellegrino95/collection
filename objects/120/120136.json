  "text": "Imagine entering a large mansion and being greeted by your hosts in a large reception hall lined with these pillars. Made of imported Burmese teakwood, these were truly lavish productions, each pillar having a hand carved foliate capital and lotus-shaped stone base. They were popular between the 19th-20th centuries, when merchant families, called chettiyars, from Chettinad (literally ‘merchant country’), Tamil Nadu, gained great riches by conducting business in India and Burma. Many of these mansions still stand in this region today, and some have fallen into disrepair. These pillars evoke the previously luxurious standard of living with their fine material and exquisite craftsmanship.",
