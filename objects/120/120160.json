  "text": "While some contemporary bamboo artists use irregular materials to create dynamic forms, Wada Seijiku prefers precision and regularity. This basket shows his fastidious approach, with finely and evenly fashioned bamboo strips used to create a double-walled flower basket. He used thicker pieces of bamboo to strengthen the rim, which he attached with decorative plaiting.",
