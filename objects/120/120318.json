  "text": "The British artist Freya Payne is an accomplished painter, sculptor, and printmaker. While a student at the Royal College of Art London, she received a yearlong fellowship in printmaking, and her work in etching is distinguished for its technical innovation and sophistication. This is on display in this etching, a tightly focused, intimate examination of the face of her subject and a compelling emotional portrait. Payne’s intricate etching technique presents a vivid, almost microscopic examination of human flesh, and the \r\ninfinite shades of light and shadow and varied textures found in the face.",
