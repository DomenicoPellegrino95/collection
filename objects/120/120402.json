  "text": "This ornament is worn by a man upon his chest, giving him a bull-like presence. It is a snuff and tobacco container made of cattle horns of two different colors. Throughout southern Africa, smoking tobacco and taking snuff are enjoyed as activities that enhance positive social relationships and honor the ancestors. A man’s cattle symbolize the continuity of his lineage and are closely connected with his ancestors. The use of cattle horn as containers highlights the connection between cattle as a source of wealth and the ancestral connotations of snuffing and smoking. ",
