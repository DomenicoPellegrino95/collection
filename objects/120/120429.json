  "text": "Although of small scale, the spirit of monumentality in this painting references landscapes painted during China’s Northern Song dynasty. The tall pines and primary reliance on ink-tonality to define rock and mountain forms are hallmarks of the school of painting begun by Li Cheng (919-967) and developed by Guo Xi (c. 1020 – c. 1090) of the Northern Song dynasty. Zhu Duan’s landscape, created during closing years of the 15th century, serves to show the continuation of this dominant and enduring tradition.",
