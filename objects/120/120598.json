  "text": "This elegant book for the apprentice artist is illustrated with drawings by the painter Giovanni Battista Piazzetta, a star in 18th-century Venice. He was a master in creating dramatic effects from deep shadows in contrast with bright lightening, which enhances the volumes and gives an almost palpable texture to the surface. This stylistic aspect is very evident from the plates engraved by Pitteri in this manual, even those devoted to apparently minor portions of the human body. Hands and feet were, in fact, among the most difficult parts studied by the artists. ",
