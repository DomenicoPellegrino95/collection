  "text": "This gory scene might make you feel bad for the wounded elephants, but they were deeply feared by the army of the Central Asian monarch, Timur. The elephants were the steeds of the Delhi Sultanate army, reputedly trained to toss a horse and rider in the air with their trunks.  Timur instructed his troops to fire on the elephant riders and then to attack the animals themselves. He ultimately won the battle with this strategy. The folio is a page from an important book, the history of Timur, which the Indian Mughal emperor Akbar, commissioned as a display of his own power and illustrious genealogy.  Akbar’s imperial atelier produced numerous manuscripts of the highest quality, employing the best artists from both Indian and Persian courts. This image’s flattened perspective and rocky outcroppings draw upon Iranian painterly prototypes, while the naturalism and illusionistic modeling reflect Indic style. ",
