  "text": "Ōtagaki Rengetsu’s distinctive calligraphy is an elegantly subtle yet integral part of this hanging flower vase. Her professional career had floundered for many years, and it was only in her late forties and early fifties that this nun-turned-poet finally found her fame by literally making her mark on everyday ceramics. Her poetry and calligraphic style has been emulated and forged, and it is said that Rengetsu had even signed forgeries as her own works in order to help other potters’ succeed.",
