  "text": "Male members of the Baule people of Côte d’Ivoire make wooden figures to attract and contain spiritual beings that can then be controlled. Made to look frightening, this seated monkey figure holds a small cup for sacrificial offerings. Offerings were also poured directly over the sculpture, leaving traces of animal blood, egg shell, and feathers. This process “regenerates” the spirit-force contained in the figure, which would intervene in possession and divination ceremonies. The stool on which the human monkey sits is placed atop a leopard, symbol of power and leadership.",
