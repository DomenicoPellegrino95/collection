  "text": "As a leader of the Renaissance in Germany, Albrecht Dürer often brought a scientific and mathematical mindset to his art. Yet, dark and mysterious forces also stoked his imagination. In this engraving, a witch rides backwards on a flying goat, while putti cavort below. One of these capricious baby angels struggles to retain control of the unstable sphere of fate which can roll or bounce in unpredictable directions. Another precariously supports a potted plant, perhaps a symbol of man’s taming of nature. Dürer has signed his monogram backwards, perhaps a warning that under the influence of witchcraft, the world is out of kilter.",
