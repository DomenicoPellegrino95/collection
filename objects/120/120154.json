  "text": "Kitaōji Rosanjin had already earned a reputation as a talented calligrapher when he became famous for his ceramics, which revived a variety of Japanese, Korean, and Chinese styles. His versatility and ability to quote different styles without being derivative set him apart from other modern potters. His deep knowledge was the result of operating an antique shop and gourmet club in Tokyo from 1920–1925. In 1925, he built his own kiln (Hoshigaoka) and started to produce tableware. Together with his assistant Arakawa Toyozō, who joined him in 1927, he initiated the first ceramic excavations in the 1930s.",
