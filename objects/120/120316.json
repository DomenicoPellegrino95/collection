  "text": "Nocturne: Palaces is among the most poetic of James McNeill Whistler’s Venetian creations. This print is an early proof of the image. Leaving a veil of ink on the surface of the copper printing plate and printing it on antique paper, Whistler produced magically luminous effects of light. This is a superb example of Whistler’s work at its most beautiful. Opportunities to obtain such a remarkable piece are extremely scarce, making this a jewel in the Mia’s collection.",
