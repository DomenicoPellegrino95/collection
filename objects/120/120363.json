  "text": "In Latino culture, “chula” is Spanish slang for “pretty woman” or “sweetie.” Here, Jimènez uses the word as the title for his exuberant rendering of a great-tailed grackle, a bird native to Texas and the American Southwest known for its violet-blue iridescent plumage, long tail feathers, and distinctive, ear-splitting call. \r\nSometimes called the “devil bird,” this grackle is a boisterous mischief-maker well adapted to urban environments. Jimènez satirically plays on this notion by equating this flamboyant, but irritating bird with street-wise Latino men who deliver catcalls to Latino women.",
