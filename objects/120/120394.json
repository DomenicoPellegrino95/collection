  "text": "The belief that a padlock helps secure wishes seems to be universal—think of the couples in love who attach a lock to the ramp of the Pont des Arts in Paris! In the West African Vodun religion, padlocks are attached to power figures in order to seal the incantatory words of their mission within the objects. Often, the number of padlocks are a mark of a figure’s success in warding off evil and controlling the forces of the gods, ancestors, and spirits that offer assistance to humans.",
