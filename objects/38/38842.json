  "text": "This beautifully painted stem bowl probably served as an offering vessel to hold fruit during bouquets or religious ceremonies. The bowl was made at the old Sukhothai kilns where potters specialized in wares decorated in undeglaze iron painted on a cream-white slip under a clear glaze. The vessel interior is densely painted with paired fish swimming amongst aquatic plants. The iron has fired to shades of black and brown.",
