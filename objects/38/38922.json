  "text": "Boston chairmakers consulted British pattern books for design sources, and even more often, studied the latest examples imported from London.  Rev. Samuel Checkley, who originally owned the chair (see his portrait to the left), presumably acquired it from a Boston maker or retailer. The \"1732\" numerals on the old black paint surface could refer to the publication of the owner's memoir, The Diary of the Rev. Samuel Checkley, in that same year.  ",
