  "text": "This exquisite painting depicts Shakyamuni, the historical Buddha who was born Prince Siddhartha Gautama during the sixth century b.c. in northern India. In this classic representation, the Buddha sits on a lotus pedestal supported by an elaborate lion throne, whose red cloth cover displays the inscription, \"Like a pure gilt vessel.\" The two attendant Bodhisattvas, identified by inscriptions on the back of the thanka, are \"Continuous Change\" (left) and \"Distinction Suppressor\" (right). The upper right corner shows the seventh Dalai Lama of Tibet (1708√ê57) and, also holding scriptures and seated opposite, the devotee Zhva-lu-pa. The Buddha's hand gesture, the \"turning the wheel of the law,\" signifies the expounding of his teachings. Although the open landscape and stylized cloud scrolls suggest the influence of Chinese painting, the symmetrical composition typifies Tibetan art and contributes to the image's meditative calm.\u000b",
