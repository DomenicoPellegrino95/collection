  "text": "People throughout history have found the rounded, shiny, porcelain-like shells of cowries pleasing to look at and to handle. One of the smaller species of these sea snails, found mainly in the Indian Ocean, was used for centuries as a currency in Africa. Cowrie shells also served in jewelry and for other decorative uses.\r\n \r\nThe Shango priest wearing this costume during ceremonies honoring the Yoruba god of thunder and lightning would get into a trance that resulted in energetic dancing. The countless cowrie shells and bells on the purple dyed costume added to the sensorial intensity of the performance.",
