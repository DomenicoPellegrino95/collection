  "text": "Clothing and other textiles in Morocco frequently reflect the complex aesthetic found in Islamic art, which emphasizes visual intricacy and preferences for abstraction and repetition. Moroccan textile traditions have also been enriched over the centuries by other cultures, including Jewish, African and European influences. Many popular caftan fabrics incorporate French patterns in their design, yet the choice of materials, colors, the style of weaving and the use of elaborate passementerie result in a distinctively urban Moroccan aesthetic.",
