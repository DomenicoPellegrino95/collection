  "text": "This rubbing was taken around 1920 from the carved stone chambers of an Eastern Han Dynasty funerary offering shrine belonging to the Wu Family in Shantung Province. The scene depicts a two-story residence of a Han emperor or nobleman with a homage ritual taking place on the first floor and a gathering of aristocratic women on the second level. Outside the residence is a <I>Fu shan</I> tree complete with birds and an archer drawing his bow at them. This mythological tree is figured into an important Han dynasty legend. It is the same tree as the ceramic version shown below where the <I>Fu shan</I> story is described in detail.",
