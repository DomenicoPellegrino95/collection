The fixture was hung from the ceiling, parallel to the ceiling plane, below a recessed light well holding a single bulb. An identical fixture is still in place in the entrance hall of the house; a reproduction has been made for the porch. The round panel contains the V-shaped motifs Elmslie employed in many of his designs.",
