  "text": "Southeast of Beijing, the city of Tianjin was of strategic importance in preventing direct attacks on the capital. In 1898, a group of Chinese rebelled against foreign imperialist expansion efforts, opium traders, economic manipulation, and missionary evangelism. Supported by the Chinese Imperial court and its army, the rebellion developed into the war against the foreign colonizers. Japan, as a part of an eight-nation alliance sent its army to repress the rebellion. Kiyochika, as a fervent nationalist, took great interest in this event as he did in the Sino-Japanese War, and designed several prints depicting battle scenes. This triptych represents the battle at which the Japanese Imperial Army took control Tianjin.  Japanese soldiers dressed in white uniforms are victoriously looking down on the burning city. Like other Kiyochika's war prints, this is an overly simplistic and ideological depiction of the war. Nonetheless, the composition of the rocky terrain and the idyllic background creates a beautiful landscape, demonstrating the artist's skill at compositional design.  ",
