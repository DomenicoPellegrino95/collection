  "text": "The crucified Christ is shown alive, turning his head up to his father and uttering his last words. Christ's suffering is represented with great detail and expressive power. His cheeks are streaked with bloody tears. The unusually large tusk of ivory, out of which the figure is carved, determined its \"c\"-shaped movement, which additionally underscores the body's suffering. Three further corpora by the anonymous Spanish master who carved this figure are known. One is in the Bargello in Florence, Italy. Another is still today in the church of Santa Mar√≠a in Guadalcanal, a village north of Sevilla, Spain. \r\n",
