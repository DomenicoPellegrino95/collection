  "text": "This cloth is an early example of recycling precious waste materials. Since the silkworm (Bombyx mori) is not indigenous to Africa, textile makers rely on silks imported from Asia and Europe. This wrapper alternates five narrow strips of magenta silk that came from north of the Sahara with five strips of the same silk weft and hand-spun cotton. \r\n \r\nTrans-Saharan trade has existed for centuries, requiring travel across the Sahara between its northern, eastern, and southern borders. In the nineteenth century, when this wrapper was made, Muslim traders from Tunisia and Libya transported French and Italian waste silks to the Nigerian city of Kano. \r\n ",
