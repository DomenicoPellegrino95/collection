  "text": "This painting possibly represents the moment at which Magdalen decides to retire in the wilderness in order to atone for her sins. Is the candle merely instrumental for illuminating the pages of the holy text she is reading' Is it a sign of her faith, or perhaps even symbolic of her still burning lust' Do her disheveled body and hair allude to a past life of prostitution, or do they signal her disregard for the frivolous details of mundane life'",
