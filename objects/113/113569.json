  "text": "Originality was the unifying criterion for André Marty and his indispensable consultant Roger Marx (1859-1913) when choosing artists for L'Estampe originale. When the series launched in 1893, Marty was director of the weekly Journal des artistes; Marx was an influential art critic and fine arts administrator who believed passionately in the civilizing role of art. Aimed at the bourgeois consumer, L'Estampe originale cost 120 francs (roughly $500 in today's money) for an annual subscription. In all, 95 prints were issued in nine albums, including Alexandre Charpentier's half-length figure embossed on the Title Page (it's also stamped on most prints), and George Auriol's Japanese-style woodcut on the Preface. The 1894 marketing prospectus features a facsimile of the Camille Martin lithograph in this exhibition.",
