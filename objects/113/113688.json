  "text": "The Virgin is shown breastfeeding her son with unexpected naturalism. Far from simply being a genre scene, the Virgin breastfeeding the Christ child has theological significance. Milk was seen as refined blood from the mother’s womb in medieval and early modern times. It was believed that the Virgin’s milk – just like the blood that Jesus shed on the cross – had redemptive properties.",
