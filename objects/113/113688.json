  "text": "The Virgin is shown breastfeeding her son with unexpected naturalism. She squeezes milk out of her breast by massaging it with her fingers, and Jesus, at the end of his meal, is seen as \"milk drunk,\" with his eyes unfocussed. But far from being simply a genre scene, the Virgin breastfeeding the Christ child has theological significance. Milk was seen as refined blood from the mother’s womb in medieval and early modern times. It was believed that the Virgin’s milk – just like the blood that Jesus shed on the cross – had redemptive properties.",
