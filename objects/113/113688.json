  "text": "In a scene of moving intimacy between mother and child, the Virgin Mary is seen squeezing her breast in order to nourish the baby Jesus. Details such as her fingers sinking into her flesh and the infant's slightly unfocussed gaze testify to the sculptor's careful observation of nature. This was a key element of Netherlandish art of the 1400s, which served as the main artistic model in Spain during the age of Christopher Columbus. The image of Mary breastfeeding the Christ child goes back to the Byzantine icon of the galaktotrophousa (literally, 'who nourishes with milk'). Invested with deep symbolism, the <I>Virgen de la leche</I> visualizes the true human nature of Christ. Moreover, in Medieval and Renaissance theology the Virgin's milk was interpreted as a redemptive fluid, in analogy to Christ's blood. The sculpture therefore also underscores the Virgin's role in the redemption of mankind according to Catholic belief.",
