  "text": "The designers of Kuba textiles, traditionally women, are driven by technical skill, patience, and creativity. And the experimentation and innovation comes through in their strikingly original works. These two panels are constructed entirely from raffia palm fiber. The smaller, unfinished panel is embroidered in a technique that mimics woven velvet. Thousands of tiny stitches are looped and cut to create a dense, raised texture. The larger panel is embellished with appliqu√© shapes. Several pieces are joined together, perhaps the start of larger garment, like a 12-foot-long cloth that is wrapped around the body to form a layered skirt.",
