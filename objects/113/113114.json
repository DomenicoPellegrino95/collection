  "text": "Henry Bannarn made this portrait of soprano singer and civil rights activist Cleota Collins in June 1932, when he was studying at the Minneapolis School of Arts (now MCAD). It is his earliest known work. Born in Kentucky, Bannarn's family moved to Minneapolis, when he was a child. Thanks to a grant offered to him by Minnesota philanthropist James Ford Bell, Bannarn was able to move to New York, where his studio on 306 West 141st Street became a creative center and meeting place for African American artists, musicians and poets. Within the movement known as the Harlem Renaissance, Bannarn became famous for his paintings, watercolors and sculptures and he was admired as a teacher and a mentor to younger artists.",
