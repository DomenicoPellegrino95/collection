  "text": "The Pecten Jacobaeus (scallop) was worn as a badge by the pilgrims to Santiago de Compostela since the Middle Ages. The shell also served as a multi-purpose vessel for the wayfarers, its concave shape forming a receptacle for water and for food. With its simple, perfect, symmetrical shape and radiating ribs, the Pecten Jacobaeus has been adopted through the ages as an icon par excellence, with associations ranging from Saint James the Apostle to the Shell Oil Company.
