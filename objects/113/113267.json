  "text": "While an M.F.A. student at the University of Washington in Seattle, Tepper “liberated” a mass-produced, diner-style coffee cup from the student union. He became obsessed with the cup and all it symbolized--conversations over coffee, pleasant or difficult, or the late-afternoon pick-me-up--and the repeated use, washing, and eventual damage of these everyday objects. He squished, slashed, and sanded his cups to give a sense of the acceleration of time and use, without any pretense to function or scale. His manipulation of form allows the cups to be recognizable, but to also possess a sense of animation, personality, and accumulated experience.\r\n\r\n ",
