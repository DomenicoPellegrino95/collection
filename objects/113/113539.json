  "text": "Bonington was already a prolific virtuoso when he died at 25, leaving a powerful mark on European painting. Born in England, he moved to France at 14 and fell in with the innovative painters Eug√®ne Delacroix and Paul Huet. Melding British and French influences, he forged his own seductive style and is considered one of the finest landscape painters on both sides of the English Channel. Here, as in many of his greatest works, he was less concerned with the subject than the art of quickly recording his impressions of light, color, and atmosphere.",
