  "text": "Kyoko Tokumaru meticulously fashions the components of her sculptures from porcelain clay. She then joins them together to create mini naturalistic environments that are at once familiar and fantastical. The undulation and elegant rhythm of her long leaves and twisting branches impart a weightless, aquatic quality to the work, which would seem to be playfully ironic given the brittle, hard quality of fired porcelain.  \r\n",
  "description": "cluster of fantastic plant forms extending upward from a small point on a black square metal base; long, thick leaves with a pair of tendrils inside each; tube-like elements; curving tendrils with hexagonal patterns; thick stalks near base with rings in cross-sections; cauliflower-like elements; closed flower-like elements with long, thin, tubular petals; white with touches of pale blue",
