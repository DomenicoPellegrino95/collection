  "text": "Jean Seidenberg found these southern pines near the Wolf River in Mississippi. It was during a sultry, humid weekend in June while visiting his friend Evelyn Witherspoon, who had a cottage in the little town of Kiln. Open-air sketches are rare for him because of the mosquitoes, he said, but when he does them, “I always do exactly what I see.” Here, he said, he saw the forms of the 19th-century French painter Cézanne.",
