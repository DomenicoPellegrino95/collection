  "text": "A resident of Mexico City, Denise De La Rue is known for her interest in outsider groups within Latin American cultures. In 2006, she started to make portraits of Mexican and Spanish matadors. Bullfighting is an extremely contentious tradition. Both <I>Jose Ignacio Uceda Leal, Madrid, Spain</I> and <I>David Luguillan, Madrid, Spain</I> (both 2006) capture the flamboyant and dramatic identities of bullfighters, yet they are also portrayed as anachronisms - aging icons of a spectacle deeply rooted in the past. Part warrior and part ballet dancer, they are lionized as much for their stylish posturing and costumes as for their sport, which has long been the subject of disapproval outside of Spain and Latin America. Framed against the time-worn backdrops of old palaces and museums, the focus of these portraits is, ultimately, the faded glamour and lost bravado of the bullfighter. ",
