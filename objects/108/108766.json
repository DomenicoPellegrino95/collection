  "text": "This remarkably vibrant icon was made large enough for processions and ritual display. Like all Ethiopian icons, its composition is based on a set pattern featuring scenes from the lives of Christ, Mary, and saints. The depiction of Mary with the Child is directly inspired by the famous icon in the Santa Maggiore church in Rome, which became known throughout Ethiopia since around 1600 when Jesuit missionaries began distributing reproductions.",
  "description": "two wood panels attached in book form with string; traces of gesso and fragments of running border designs in black on outer front cover; each inner panel split into three horizontal frames showing various scenes including Jesus with the 12 apostles, Mary and infant Jesus with a pair of angels with swords, the crucifixion, Daniel with two lions and St. George slaying a serpent-like dragon; orange, yellow, grey-blue, black and white",
