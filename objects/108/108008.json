  "text": "This eccentric portrait fits into no clear pictorial tradition. The exaggerated perspective caused Rembrandt, seen in extreme close-up in the immediate foreground, to upstage Saskia, who sat on the far side of the table. Having paused in his work, the right-handed artist has a loose left-handed grasp on his drawing instrument. The marks on the paper suggest he was in the process of drawing her until interrupted. The couple stares out at the viewers. Rembrandt, of course, must have been looking directly into a mirror.",
