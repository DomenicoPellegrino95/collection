  "text": "Recognized for his discerning sense of humor, Surrealist artist, poet, and cartoonist Maurice Henry satirizes the boxed activity kits marketed to young boys and girls in this absurdist-inspired version tailored for the juvenile pyromaniac. Outfitted with matches, lighter, kindling materials, gasoline, and printed instructions, Henry's instructional game is every parent's nightmare. \r\n\r\nAs the title notes, the work honors French Surrealist novelist and poet Rene Daumal (1908-1944), widely respected for his writings on spiritualism and perception.\r\n",
