  "text": "If you look into the dark gray and black interior of Dark Kiva, you can see male figures, articulated from iron wire, around the inner circumference. Giles meant these figures to evoke the all-male tribal gatherings of ancient cultures, particularly the Pueblo kivas of the American Southwest. In fact, the form can be seen as a reference to the local landscape of that region as well. Giles studied with Walter Nottingham, a fiber art professor at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls, and Ferne Jacobs, a well-known fiber artist, to develop both her technique and her trademark coiled basket style.\r\n ",
