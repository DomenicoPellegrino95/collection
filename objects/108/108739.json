  "text": "Dinka men used to dress lightly—until recently, they simply covered their torsos in tight, beaded corsets, highlighting their lithe figures. But these garments did more than that: the colors of the beads signal social and marital status as well as the wearer’s age. Red and black means a young man between 15 and 25 years old.",
  "description": "strands of red and black beads attached to central bars of cloth-covered metal with ties; rigid, arcing thread-covered bar with bead strands between (white, black and red) on back; pouch-like bottom element in front of brown cloth with black, red and white beaded strands with some highlighting blue beads; tassel of blue, black and red beads on back; cowrie shell at front top of \\\"pouch\\\"",
