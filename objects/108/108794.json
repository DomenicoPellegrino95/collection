  "text": "Melinda Fawver studied wood turning with Frank E. Cummings III, one of the first in the field to do piercing of the wood vessel.  The technique has become very popular in wood art now, especially combined with polychroming.  Fawver now carves and paints her pieces in addition to piercing, but this piece emphasizes the graphic designs achievable through piercework on a turned form, often with the use of dental tools. ",
