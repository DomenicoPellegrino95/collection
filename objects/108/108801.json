  "text": "Although made from the same material as Hoyer's \"Gourd Series\" piece featured in this same grouping, with this vessel Hoyer chooses to conceal the surface of the wood rather than manipulating its naturally occurring irregularities. White grout accentuates the cracks in the blackened and charred surface. Playing with this textured surface, gold and black ribbons of color snake their way over and around the exterior of the vessel, adding to the decorative scheme of the surface and further obscuring the wood grain. Delicate cracks emanate from the mouth of the vessel, revealing the strength and fragility of its material structure.",
