  "text": "Chiang Ai, from Hu-t'ing, Kiangsu province, was a landscape painter who followed in the style of Shen Shih-ch'ung. He was particularly famous for his renditions of masterworks of the T'ang and Sung dynasties. According to Chiang's inscription, this work is after an original by the Northern Sung landscape painter Kuan T'ung (10th c.), titled <I>Waiting for the Ferry<I> now in the National Palace Museum,  Taipei, Taiwan. That work is often cited as one of the great early paintings of the Sung monumental landscape style. In this scroll, Chiang follows the size and basic composition of the original rather closely. However, the brushwork is more abbreviated and fluid than the meticulous brushstrokes of Kuan's original. It is a clear demonstration of how Chinese artists learned through the study and interpretation of past masters. This painting is a classic example of a commissioned copy; signed and dated by the artist, it gives full credit to the original source. This painting bears the seals of the Ma brothers; famous 18th century Yangchou collectors.",
