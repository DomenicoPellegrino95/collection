  "text": "Moore's mother, a fan of early modern wood turner Bob Stocksdale (also represented in this exhibition), taught him wood turning in the 1950s. Moore's subsequent degree in sculpture prepared him to experiment with metal in his wood objects; he is now one of the few wood artists to explore this combination of materials. His metal elements, spun on a lathe and patinated, are integral to his designs. \r\n\r\nMoore's <I>Tray for Apollo</I> reinterprets the ancient Greek kylix form on a larger scale and in different materials (an historic example is on view in Gallery 241). It could be a container for an offering, or more likely, meant as a drinking cup suitable for one of ancient Greece's most prominent gods.",
