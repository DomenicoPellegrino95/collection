  "text": "When the second Mughal emperor, Humayan (r.1530-1540) returned to India after visiting the Persian court in 1556, he brought with him two court artists, Sayyid Ali and Abdus Samad. Their paintings in Islamic and Persian styles were assimilated with local Indian themes and styles during succeeding decades to produce a distinctive style known as Mughal miniature painting. Under Akbar (r. 1556-1605), the imperial court at Fatephur Sikri emerged as a center of cultural excellence. However, hundreds of Indian artists trained in Mughal painting technigues and worked at numerous regional courts. They painted scenes from the Hindu epics like the <I>Ramayana<I> and the <I>Mahabharata<I>, as well as portraits of local rulers and court life.\r\n<P>This rare, early Mughal painting illustrates a major episode from the great Indian epic, the <I>Ramayana<I> written by Valmiki over two thousand years ago. The scene depicts the rescue of Sita, wife of Rama, who is held captive by the evil King Ravana, in the golden city of Lanka. Lanka was protected by furious demons, but Rama (in blue) and his brother Laksman, recruited bear and monkey armies to lay siege to the city and rescue his faithful wife, Sita.",
