  "text": "Ethiopian Christian art developed its own style once the new faith became the state religion in the 350s. This painting on parchment belongs to a larger ensemble of 44 leaves featuring Ethiopian saints and scenes from the Hebrew Scriptures and New Testament. Here we see the Ascension—Christ ascending to heaven with the apostles below and angels above—with figures identified in Ge’ez, an ancient language now used only in a liturgical context.",
