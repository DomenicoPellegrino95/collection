  "text": "Mequitta Ahuja combines history, myth, and personal narrative in a unique form of self-portraiture, which by her own account mediates her relationship to the world. She calls these artistic and cultural explorations \"Automythography,\" something she defines as \"a constructive process of identity formation in which nature and self-invention mergeâ€¦.\" \r\n\r\nAhuja's exuberant crayon drawing of cascading dreadlocks is one of a series of works that resulted from her ongoing artistic investigations into her cultural, racial, and gender identity. Born to an African American mother and East Indian father, she was raised in a generally white community in Connecticut. As a result, her experiences with the black community were extremely limited until she reached college, a truth she recognized and used as a catalyst for her journey of self-discovery. ",
