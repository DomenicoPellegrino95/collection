  "text": "The late Ming artist Cao Xi excelled at fan painting. He was from Suzhou but lived and worked primarily in Hangzhou where he absorbed the dynamic brushwork of the Zhe school style indigenous to that region.\r\n<P>Two lively rustic sages are shown here discoursing expressively under a dripping old pine tree. The inscription however adds a layer of political commentary to this work, which was executed around the time of the collapse of the increasingly corrupt Ming court resulting in the Manchu takeover in 1644. It reads\r\n\r\n<P><I>Crippled Zhang, carrying dishes of food, off to visit kin,\r\n<P>meets hunchbacked Li along the way, and \r\n<P>talks \"causality\" with him.\r\n<P>The two men clap their hands in glee,\r\n<P>and laugh out loud: Ha, ha!\r\n<P>Nowhere in this world is there a man\r\n<P>who stands quite straight!</I>",
