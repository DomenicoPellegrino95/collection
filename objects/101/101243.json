  "text": "In his monumental publication <I>Works in Architecture<I/>, Robert Adam illustrated his work at 20 St. James's Square in London, the townhouse of Sir Watkins Williams-Wynn.  Adam designed every aspect of its highly influential interior, including all furnishings, to create a total work of art inspired by archeological motifs.  These plates belong to the elaborate dinner service Adam designed for 20 St. James Square.  Whether serving meats during the second course at dinner, or on display along the sideboard, these plates were made to reflect the spare elegance of the interior. ",
