  "text": "Ch'eng Ming was born in She-hsien in Anhui province and lived and worked near Yang Chou. He was a noted poet and a student of the great individualist artist Shih-t'ao. He was also influenced by the important Anhui master Ch'eng Sui to whom he was possibly related. The painting depicts a literati recluse visiting a scholarly friend in his wintry mountain retreat. The spiky calligraphic brushwork of the rocks is counterbalanced by Ch'eng's own poem, which reads:\r\n\r\n<P><I>Willow catkins, reed embroidery, wind through the entire night.<I>\r\n<P><I>But still, there is the plank bridge for crossing the flowery stream.<I>\r\n<P><I>That man lives here, in evening blue-green, in midst of chilly fragrance.<I> \r\n<P><I>As spring comes to a thousand cliffs and a myriad ravines.<I>\r\n<P><I>Cheng Ming, Sung-men composed this (in addition to the painting) as well.<I>\r\n",
