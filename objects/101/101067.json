  "text": "Johann Samuel Beckensteiner was a master silversmith in 18th century Nuremberg, a major center of silver production.  Beckensteiner made a variety of silver forms, including ritual objects for both the Christian and Jewish communities. This type of Havdalah object, combining a holder for a ritual candle and a drawer to hold the aromatic spices, was developed and used in the 18th century only in Germany.  It is used during the Havdalah ceremony marking the end of the Sabbath on Saturday evening.  Artists continue to copy this form even in the present day.",
