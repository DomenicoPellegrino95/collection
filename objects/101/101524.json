  "text": "The yellow HAZMAT has become a modern symbol of disaster response, usually from hazardous chemicals, biological agents, radioactive materials, and often of humanity's own making. This impermeable whole-body garment is worn as protection against hazardous materials and used primarily by personnel responding to toxic spills, specialists cleaning up contaminated facilities, and workers in toxic environments. Complete with eye protection, rubber gloves, and thick boots the uniform protects from even imperceptible dangers. ",
