  "text": "In the series Eight Views of Ømi, the theme of \"retuning sailboats\" traditionally pictures the ferry port at Yabase. In this print, for his series Eight Views of the Sumida River, Hiroshige II depicted Azuama bridge, which crosses the river near Asakusa, one of the most bustling quarters of the city. In the background, a dense grove surrounding a red pagoda represents the temple compound of Sensøji. To suggest \"returning sails\" the artist depicted barges heavily loaded with goods for the city's burgeoning population. One of the boats is shown lowering its sail so that it can safely pass beneath the bridge. ",
