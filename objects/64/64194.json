  "text": "Awaji is an island located in the eastern part of the Seto Inland Sea in the southwest Japan. The island's west coast is covered with pebbles in various colors, hence the nickname Goshikihama, or Multi-colored Beach. Fishermen in this print are shown trawling their nets from an offshore reef, where sea bream have long been known to breed in summer. Skillfully coordinating their efforts from separate boats, the fishermen drop large nets in the shallow waters. Beyond the fishing scene, Hiroshige depicted the rocks and mountains of the coastline.
