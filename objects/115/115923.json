  "text": "A long history and tradition stands behind the industry and art of glassworking in the Venetian islands of Murano. This vase, one of Bianconi's pezzati series for Venini, exemplifies the boldness of design and color that typified post-World War II Italian glass. It was one of several series by the young Paduan illustrator-turned-designer that revitalized the firm during this period. Pezzati means spotted or patched, and the overlapping spots of vivid color that decorate this irregularly formed vase impart the feel of a contemporaneous abstract painting. The Venini firm was a center of the new modern approach in glass art at the time, hiring other major modern designers including Gio Ponti, Tobia Scarpa, and Tapio Wirkkala.",
