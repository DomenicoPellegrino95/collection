  "text": "A long history and tradition stands behind the industry and art of glassworking in the Venetian islands of Murano. This vase, one of Bianconi's Pezzati series for Venini, was part of an early 20th century movement away from the traditional Muranese styles of glasswork. Venini was major site of this stylistic break and a center of the new modernist approach in design after the Second World War, hiring other major modern designers including Gio Ponti, Massimo Vignelli, and Tobia Scarpa.\r\n\r\nPezzati means spotted. The overlapping patches of vivid color that decorate this irregularly formed vase, its \"spots\", impart a distinctly modernist feeling, evoking the composition and feel of a contemporaneous abstract painting. Blocks of color and the carefully irregular shape of the vessel show this new emphasis on abstraction. \r\n\r\n",
