  "text": "Dahl was the father of Norwegian landscape painting, the first artist to capture the majesty of his country's contours. He made this painting shortly after arriving in Dresden, Germany, to impress his teacher there, Caspar David Friedrich, the leading German Romantic artist. Friedrich's influence is seen in the modest scale of the man-made structures—the castle and the cottage—which heightens the grandeur of the landscape. \r\nRecent conservation of this picture was made possible by a generous contribution from Al and Dena Naylor through the Adopt-a-Painting program.",
