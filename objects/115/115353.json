  "text": "Why would this elegant instrument sometimes be called a 'talking drum'' Technically speaking, it's not a drum'it has no membrane, the sound emanating instead from a narrow slit in the hollowed-out center. But slit gongs were used to communicate, as the sides of the instrument were made of slightly different thicknesses to produce two different pitches'a high tone and a low tone'when struck by mallets or bare hands. This contrast can mimic the words of a tonal language, essentially 'talking.'",
  "description": "wood slit drum- \\\"V\\\" designs carved along edges of sides; diamond design at end of slit; four curved legs; barrel shape extensions on ends",
