  "text": "Mysteriously clad men contort themselves while flying kites--quite an unconventional scene for a formal-looking vessel. Dailey brings humor and historical references to this glass piece, though his subject matter is contemporary. The clear glass body with engraved decoration references 1930s Swedish glass vases, and the wrapping of the vase with figures engaged in various activites relates to ancient Greek pottery (you can see examples in Gallery 241 nearby). Daileyâ€™s background ranging from commercial glass design to founding the studio glass department at the Massachusetts College of Art has allowed him to combine technical proficiency with artistic playfulness.
