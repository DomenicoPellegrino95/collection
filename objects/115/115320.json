  "text": "Were these delicately carved forearms, found in an ancient Egypt tomb, given by one spouse to another as a final sign of affection' In fact, they’re percussive instruments, used as an accompaniment to rattles, harps, and pipes. And while we will never know exactly how ancient Egyptian music sounded, there are hieroglyphs and wall paintings that show us how these clappers were played: struck together just as you’d clap your own hands.",
