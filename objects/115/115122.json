  "text": "This jar was purchased along the banks of the Nile in 1990 from the potter at a price the most common Egyptian could afford. Images of similar vessels can be found in Ancient tomb paintings and hieroglyphic carved panels in Egypt. The rounded base allows it to be propped up easily in the sand. A rope can be strung through the lug handles in order to pull the filled jar from a river. This type of jar continues to be used daily in villages along the Nile and its basic design and purpose has  not changed for thousands of years.",
