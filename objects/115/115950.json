  "text": "Hobson is known for her striking pâte de verre sculptures. The artist began experimenting with the \"glass paste\" technique in the 1970s, and her innovations and experimentations helped pave the way for other artists to explore pâte de verre. This process of placing ground glass into a mold, heating it, and freeing it allows for the object to appear almost aged, as if excavated from an ancient site. Through this process, Hobson aims to make the glasswork as thin and transparent as possible. Her pieces have been described to be so incredibly fine and thin that they resemble spun sugar. Her focus on light and transparency is evident in this untitled work, as the vessel-like form emphasizes the organic quality of the glass material, with swirls of carefully placed deep blue and gold as a bold counterpart to the translucent white.",
