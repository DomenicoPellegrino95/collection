  "text": "Art glass has been made in Murano (a chain of small islands in the Venetian lagoon) for centuries. In the early twentieth century, Murano glass artists broke away from traditional styles and incorporated aspects of the new philosophy of modernism.\r\n \r\nIn 1932, when the workshop A.V.E.M. was founded, the modernist style had been influencing Murano glass for more than a decade. In the 1950s, the designers of A.V.E.M. created graphic, abstracted works like this patchwork vase. Rods of twisted colored glass (the complex pattern is called zanfirico) are arranged into squares, fused into a sheet and then rolled to form the body of the vessel, combining modernist patterns and traditional techniques.",
