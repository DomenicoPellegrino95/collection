  "text": "Swedish/German artist Ann Wolff entered the glass industry in the 1960s as a designer of decorative household objects. In the 1970s, Wolff established a studio on the grounds of her home in Transj√∂, Sweden; she now has studios in Kyllaj and Visby, Sweden. In the following decades, her work has emphasized, almost exclusively, all aspects of womanhood. As such, her pieces move beyond the mere materiality of glass to provoke intelligent interaction. While her pieces contain elements of narration, they often leave much of the meaning open to be interpreted by the viewer. In this untitled piece, Wolff portrays what could be understood as a narrative scene, including two women with a rabbit, without explicitly assigning meaning. Thus, this acid-etched scene displays the artist's subliminally psychological explorations that are open to interpretation from a woman's point of view.",
