  "text": "Seattle-based Paul Marioni is a groundbreaking artist of the American studio glass movement. His roots as a filmmaker during 1960s led Marioni to experiment with aspects of light, which transferred to his work in glass. He still continues to push the boundaries of the medium. <P>Marioni is inspired by both his own dream life and human nature as a whole and his work borrows from many different cultures and traditions. In <I>Black Bird</I>, the artist alludes to ceremonial masks, particularly those of the Northwest Coast Native American tribes. The black bird or raven imagery is seen both in the <I>Transformation Mask</I> and the <I>House Screen<I> displayed here. Placed among objects used in a Northwest Coast potlach, it shows how Marioni, an artist working in Washington, a hotbed of studio glass, borrowed and interpreted imagery from sacred stories of local tribes. \r\n",
