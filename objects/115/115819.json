  "text": "A woman is embraced in the harsh flash of a camera—an intimate portrait of the photographer, Nan Goldin, with her boyfriend. It’s one of 700 images in Goldin’s series The Ballad of Sexual Dependency. A visual diary of her life in the late 1970s and early 1980s, from erotic trysts to drug use to quiet bliss, the work is deeply personal yet universal in its depiction of human relationships and emotions.",
