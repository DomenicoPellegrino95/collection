  "text": "Doug Rickard is acutely aware of the causes of poverty and the challenges facing minority populations in the United States through his studies in history and sociology at the University of California, San Diego. Using Google Street View, he has explored blighted urban areas throughout the country via the images captured by Google’s roof-mounted 360° cameras.  He composes his images by “framing” compelling scenes on his computer screen. He then documents the image by photographing the screen with his digital camera. The resulting pictures—with their peripheral blurriness and capricious coloration—heighten the sense of alienation and disenfranchisement that characterized these neglected communities. ",
