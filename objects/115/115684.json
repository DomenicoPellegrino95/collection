  "text": "In his paintings and some 35 etchings, Cornelis Bega focused his somewhat jaundiced eye on peasants and low-life tavern scenes. Here, he presents us with a well-oiled couple who have settled in on some crude tavern furniture. They have enjoyed a smoke and are half way through a bottle. The man's hat is pulled down too far for us to see his eyes, but beneath his bulbous nose, a strong chin projects well past a mouth that seems to lack teeth. His left arm is draped around the ample woman's shoulder, and his right hand grasps her breast. She seems to enjoy-or at least tolerate-the attention. Perhaps she is used to such advances, for her fur cap, pearl earring, and dainty if precarious hold on her glass suggest that she is a professional.\r\n\r\nIn both quality of impression and state of preservation, this etching is a small miracle. In the 20th century it passed through a series of extraordinary collections and was repeatedly noted for its remarkable quality.",
