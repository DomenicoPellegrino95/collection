  "text": "Part of jeweler and artist Mary Margrill's One World Collection, this necklace unites the symbols of seven world faiths. They are held together by the universal symbol of peace, which forms the clasp in the back. Moving down from the clasp, one comes across: the Yin-Yang symbol of Taoism, the Crescent Moon and Stars of Islam, the Cross of Christianity, the sign for Om of Hinduism, the Star of David of Judaism, the Wheel of Buddhism, and the Hexagram of Confucianism. \r\n\r\nMargrill attended Bennington College, VT, and the School of Visual Art in NYC. At once painter, sculptor and jeweler, her work expresses a vision of universal harmony and understanding across religions. Unlike the other portable artworks in this gallery, the One World Necklace is truly ecumenical in spirit, carrying the message that, in Margrill's words, \"everybody is really just trying to get to the same place.\"\r\n",
