  "text": "Through her work, Wendy Red Star explores issues of authenticity and representation. In this pseudo-diorama, using kitschy wallpaper, plastic animals and scenery, the artist sits wearing her traditional Apsaalooka (Crow) outfit, the same type of garments her ancestors wore. This photograph blurs the line from stereotype to reality, from Native American as scenery to fabricated Hollywood sets, from authenticity to Western fantasy.",
