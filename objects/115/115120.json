  "text": "The Blessed Gerard of Villamagna is named after a village near Florence, where he retreated from the world. An orphan of humble origins, Gerard had participated in the crusades, lived in Syria for seven years, and worked his way up to become a Knight of Malta. But after he met Saint Francis back in his native Tuscany, Gerard became a member of the Third Franciscan Order, and henceforth led a solitary life helping the sick and the poor. Gerard is most famous for healing an ill man by serving him cherries, which his prayer caused to suddenly grow in the midst of winter. The present statue was originally part of a larger altarpiece, from which two further figures of Saint Francis and Saint Anthony of Padua survive in other collections.",
