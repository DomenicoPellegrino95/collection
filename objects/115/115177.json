  "text": "This photograph presents a suburban landscape with concrete driveways radiating from a cul-de-sac.  Bright green lawns, pruned trees and shrubs, and a formally planted roadway island suggest the obsessions and aspirations held by many modern Americans. But the key element of the American dream--the house--is missing. An ominous grey sky fills the background, and the scene is devoid of people, suggesting is awry. Using Adobe Photoshop software, Prahl manipulates his photographs, meticulously adding and subtracting elements to produce a wholly compelling vision. It can take up to nine months and countless refinements before Prahl is satisfied with the image.",
