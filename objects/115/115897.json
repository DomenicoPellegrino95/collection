  "text": "Glass fusing is now very popular, but Moje helped revive mosaic glass, or murrine, through fusing on a large, painterly scale decades ago. He concentrated on shallow dish forms or square panels with vivid juxtapositions of color, taking kiln-fused glass to another, bolder level. These two shallow dishes exploit his loose approach with saturated secondary and primary colors on a dark ground spilling off the plate like paint thrown on a canvas. He has influenced several younger generations of artists working with this technique, as founding director and instructor at the Glass Workshop, Canberra School of Art in Canberra, Australia. ",
