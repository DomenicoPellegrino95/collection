  "text": "A graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design and an instructor there from 1982-2006, Michael Glancy has developed a combination aesthetic/scientific approach to his glass sculptures that reflect his understanding of both macro- and micro- world views. Inspired by irregular patterns of cells as well as strict geometry, Glancy painstakingly creates exquisite, dense vessel forms that he sandblasts, carves and combines with copper--applied through electroforming--as an opaque foil for the gem-like colored glass. He most often presents the vessels in concert with or in contrast to a blown or plate-glass base. In Biomorphic Ganglia, the vessel and the base form a continuous landscape, such as rocks in a stream, or a molecular reference. The multiple colors of the vase conjoin seamlessly with the engraved blue plate glass.",
