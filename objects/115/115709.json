  "text": "In contrast to the traditional use of porcelain, which often celebrated the innocent, the carefree, and the cute, Louise Hindgavl uses the medium to dig into the dramatic depths of the human psyche. Abstract and figurative elements merge to convey a sense of drama and urgency at the tipping point between dream and nightmare. ",
