  "text": "German artist Moje was the founding director and instructor at the Glass Workshop, Canberra School of Art in Canberra, Australia.  He helped revive murrine (mosaic) glass on a large, painterly scale. Instead of creating vessels, he has concentrated on shallow dish forms or square panels with vivid juxtapositions of color, taking fused glass to another, bolder level, and influencing younger generations working with glass fusing. This early piece is uncharacteristic of Moje's typical colorful compositions. He created this carefully-composed dish by combining deep blue glass as a background with mosaic glass in crimson, burgundy, and white to form a dynamic pattern. Although not immediately evident, when held to light, the murrine sections become beautifully translucent.",
