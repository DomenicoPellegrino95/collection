  "text": "In the mid-1970s, Ben Tré was drawn to the artistic potential of industrial glass, and began the unique process of casting glass--which had been explored very little in the U.S.--to form archetypal abstract sculptures. Later, while at the Rhode Island School of Design, and in his Providence-area studios, Ben Tré increasingly combined translucent cast glass with metals, gold leaf, oxides, or granite to produce original sculptures. An important early work experimenting with cast glass, opacity, and metal inclusions, Cast Form is part of a group of small objects that reference ancient ruins, such as ziggurats, that reflected the artist's travels and interests. It is an important precedent to large-scale public artworks that have been his focus since the late 1980s. ",
