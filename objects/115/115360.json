  "text": "This drawing manual starts with a series of engravings depicting single parts of the human body. These are followed by reproductions of works by famous artists, especially the Bolognese painter Agostino Carracci, active in the later 16th century. This progression reflects traditional artistic education, from the study of details of human anatomy to their use in larger and more elaborate compositions. The leg in this page is examined from the point of view of the anatomist, to better understand its functioning. Small circles mark the joints-one of which is shown on the side, studied to the bones, with an effect foreshadowing modern x-rays.",
