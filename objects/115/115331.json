The prints offer patterns for the aspiring draftsman to copy, with isolated body parts—eyes, ears, noses, hands, arms, feet, legs, torsos—and concise figure and animal designs. Mastering the simple forms presented in these books, which also introduced conventions of foreshortening and proportion, was an important first step in learning the art of drawing.",
