  "text": "Over the last forty years Dailey has been deeply involved in the world of studio glass. His foundation of the Glass Department of the Massachusetts College of Art in 1972 is only one of his many contributions to art glass education. He has also designed for companies such as Steuben Glass, Cristallerie Daum, and Fenton Art Glass Company and in countries from Italy to the United States. Whimsy and narrative'along with glass innovation'are important components of his work. \r\nSpace Gun is an early work, perhaps made for the artist's own enjoyment, as it departs from Dailey's figural vases and sculptures. The hot-worked gun references the heroes of early 20th century space comics, television, and movies, such as the ever-popular Buck Rogers. ",
