As one of the most inaccessible mountains in Central Italy, the setting provided St. Francis with the ideal place to attain an intimate connection with God while living in solitude. After fasting and praying for forty days, the Saint was visited by an angel who performed Stigmata on the Saint by replicating Christâ€™s crucifixion wounds on his body. ",
