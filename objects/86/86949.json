  "text": "Pattern repeats are integral to efficient textile production for the producer as well as the interior designer. The fabric designer’s challenge is to blend sequences so they don’t appear to repeat. The top and bottom edges of this panel show the skill involved in devising subtle sequences. Guess how many times the pattern repeats here. Also note the efficient use of color production in the color bars along the fabric’s edges. Although only eight colors were applied, several additional shades were created by layering colors.",
