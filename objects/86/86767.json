  "text": "Incorporating the unexpected into a fabric was an important aspect of the design decision for the Larsen team.  In the late 1980s the studio, working with a Swiss mill, began to explore the possibilities of a sheer double cloth.  This weave structure was one of Jack's favorites (as it was for William Morris!), but it was most often used to explore and exploit color potential.<P>  \r\nIn this particular instance the interest comes from an optical effect created when two plain weave, voile fabrics are joined in a way that allows some independent movement of the individual panels.  Using a double weave structure, patterns were developed that controlled the size and shape of  'pocketed' areas where a spontaneous moiré texture might develop.  As the fabric moves, the moiré pattern changes.  Between 1986 and 1991 four different Hologram textiles were introduced into the Larsen collection.",
