  "text": "The inspiration for the <I>Rhythm and Line<I> collection came from wondering how children heard music. Weitzner worked during the summer of 1993 with a group of fifteen children from New York City who were enrolled in the National Dance Institute's multicultural summer dance classes. She gave the youngsters, ranging in age from eight to eleven years, a grab bag of paints, colored pencils, brushes and squeegees, and asked them to recreate what they heard when listening to a range of music from Vivaldi to jazz.\r\n\r\nSee the case in this gallery for more information relating to <I>Barrel House<I>, from initial development, through weaving refinements, and finally, greater exposure for the <I>Rhythm and Line<I> collection as publications took notice of this innovative design process.",
