  "text": "Using a silk screen print process, the <I>Bamako</I> pattern was applied to the warp threads of the cloth before they were woven, a technique that created a reversible fabric. However, during the weaving process, the mill could not maintain the horizontal calibration of the pattern. As a result, the panels did not align when sewn together for drapery. This one-of-a-kind sample never when into production.",
