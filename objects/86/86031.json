  "text": "Color is a vital element of design. For the textile designer it is particularly challenging, as the decisions need to consider the particulars of the graphic as well as the potential use of the fabric, which for most Larsen textiles meant cloth for use in interiors. Frequently the pattern is produced in several hues and by employing different colorways the designer can convey distinctly different moods and styles with the same graphic.\r\n\r\nHere we can see that the designer chose to create two color ways with hues not\r\ntraditionally associated with roses, and thus was able to broaden the emotional impact beyond the sweetness and sentimentality often associated with floral designs.  \r\n\r\nFor further considerations of the color decisions for this pattern, please see the case display in this gallery.\r\n",
