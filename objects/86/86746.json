  "text": "When Larsen introduced <I>Hills of Home</I> in the early 1970s, this dramatic landscape print made a bold statement. Winston Prints, in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, printed the pattern on handwoven silk fabric imported from India. Normally four screens were used, but if a custom ground fabric was used, manufacturers added an additional screen. <I>Hills of Home</I> was discontinued in 1992.",
