  "text": "Larsen was famous for producing cloth that highlighted the distinctive qualities of natural fiber. The company sought out yarns that were not overly refined, using them in woven structures that enhanced their special effects. The Doria and Haitian Primitive series were handwoven in Colombia and the Caribbean, respectively, and remained popular for more than twenty years. Frank Lloyd Wright specified <I>Doria</I> for several homes he designed. Two of the <I>Doria Squares</I> color ways were commissioned for Air Force One in 1969 when Richard Nixon was president.",
