  "text": "<I>Gossamer</I>, a very popular, pleated casement fabric with irregular repeats, was made possible by the printing and heat-setting innovations developed by Japanese mills. Sheer and solid fabrics, <I>Pierotte</I> and <I>Carefree</I>, which related to the opaque and transparent areas of the design were also developed by the studio, but they were never as popular as <I>Gossamer</I>.<P> \r\nIn the last decade of the 20th century, polyester was refined in ways that enhanced its resistance to the destructive effects of sunlight. This improvement gave it a distinct advantage over silk, which degrades rapidly under such conditions, and it was often used by the design team.",
