  "text": "According to Chinese mythology, a long-legged race (Ashinaga) and a long-armed one (Tenaga) live along China's Eastern Sea. In the spirit of peaceful coexistence, they help each other fish: the Ashinaga carry the Tenaga on their shoulders into the ocean, where Tenaga snatch food from the deep water. Despite the fanciful nature of the subject, the artist of this sculpture achieves a high degree of realism through his attention to minute detail. ",
