Extremely beautiful as a young woman, she cruelly rejected all suitors and is said to have passed her old age in solitude and squalor. Because of this, she became emblematic of <I>mono-no-aware<I>, the melancholy awareness that all enjoyment is fleeting and thus tinged with sadness. Artists frequently showed her as old and decrepit.
