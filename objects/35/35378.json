  "text": "Kenojauk Ashevak is one of the first women printmakers among the Inuit.  Born in 1927, she lived the traditional lifestyle until she settled at Cape Dorset in 1967.  She began to draw in the late 1950's and carved much later.  Most of her work concentrates in owl imagery.  \r\n      Ashevak has achieved worldwide recognition for her work.  Her 1960 print \"Enchanted Owl\" was used in a stamp designed to commemorate the Northwest Territories Centennial, and in 1967 she received the Order of Canada Award from the Governor General for her major contribution to her country through her art.\r\n",
