  "text": "As Japan rapidly modernized in the late 19th century, traditional demand for Buddhist images, swords, and sword fittings diminished. Skilled metalsmiths, inspired by the western tradition of realistic bronze sculpture, began to produce decorative objet d'art for the export market. American and European collectors, enamored with the exotic island kingdom, voraciously collected figurines that depicted the Japanese themselves. Images of great samurai, beautiful women, and even ordinary farmers and fishermen were highly desirable. Here, an unknown sculptor has depicted a farmer in the process of sowing seeds.",
