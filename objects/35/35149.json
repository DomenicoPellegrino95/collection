  "text": "The history of Chinese flower-and-bird painting up to the Tang dynasty (618-907) represents a gradual, cumulative mastery of the artists' means of description and expression. Two groups of artists dominate: the academy school and the scholar-painters. The first group worked mainly with descriptive line and color on silk. They pursued a meticulous, naturalistic rendering, a dazzling surface and a sensuous effect. This painting is a good example of this style. The chrysanthemum flowers in autumnal solitude, embodying purity in its yellow blossoms. It is a favored motif among literati artists.\r\n\r\nGuan Daosheng, a native of Qingpu, in present-day Shanghai, was an accomplished poet, painter, and calligrapher of the Yuan dynasty. She was married to Zhao Mengfu (1254-1322), a prince and descendant of the Song dynasty who became one of the most influential scholars, painters, and calligraphers in Chinese history. Their second son, Zhao Yong, also became a famous painter and calligrapher.\r\n",
