  "text": "Stone-cut printing began among the Inuit in Cape Dorset, Canada in the late 1950's and is still in use.  First, the artist flattens and polishes a large stone, which is then carved with the chosen design.  Ink is applied to the stone and a lightweight paper is placed on top.  The paper is then rubbed to transfer the carved image onto the paper.  This artistic method is used by the Inuit to depict the important themes in their beliefs and culture.  They have a high level of respect for the animals who share their environment and portray them frequently in their art.  ",
