  "text": "This kind of figure represents a forest spirit and was used in ceremonies celebrating a boy's coming of age. The white color, made from kaolin clay, is associated with maleness, and the red color, from iron-rich soil, with femaleness. In many African cultures, spirit beings are depicted in a highly abstract, stylized way. This two-faced figure constitutes a case in point: the body is reduced to a trunk with a waist, and the head has become a geometric play of volume, plane, and color. ",
