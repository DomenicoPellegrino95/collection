  "text": "German sculptor, filmmaker, and installation artist Rebecca Horn is renowned for her multi-media art that explores the physical, psychological, and emotional interactions between the human body and the environment, often focusing on the concept of equilibrium. That idea is manifest in this enigmatic double-headed hammer that usurps the materiality and usual function of the common hammer. Referencing some of her past mechanized installations, this precious but absurd hand tool serves as a metaphor for the ephemeral truths of human memory and experience. ",
