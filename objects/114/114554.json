  "text": "Thomas Demand was born in 1964 in Munich, Germany, where he grew up surrounded by art. He has been called an illusionist of the real, is known for making photographs of three-dimensional models that look like real images of rooms and other spaces. The artist chooses his subjects for their social and political associations and provocation and meaning. Based on media photographs of Whitney Houston's last meal, which were published shortly after her death, <I>Junior Suite</I>, depicts a half-finished meal served on a table tray in a hotel room. The work, with its strange stillness of a recently vacated space, suggests the artistic genre of memento mori. The mis-en-scene invites the viewer to ponder the larger context and reality being portrayed: the last meal of a troubled celebrity, haunted by an addiction to drugs, who is leaving behind a mercurial, unfinished life and a young daughter in the next suite.",
