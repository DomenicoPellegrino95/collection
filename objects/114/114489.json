  "text": "Trained as a sculptor, Yuji Honbori has always been interested in using discarded materials in order to make his work. His first sculptures were small portable shrines (zushi) that he fashioned from old wood he discovered from the dismantling and rebuilding of a Shinto shrine. He first began experimenting with cardboard from discarded boxes (fruit and vegetable crates from his local grocery store) in 2004. He soon became fascinated with the gossamer quality of the cardboard as viewed through the corrugation. Honbori realized that this quality could suggest Buddhist notions of impermanence and ephemerality. For the last few years, he has been producing life-sized works in cardboard based on famous historic Buddhist sculptures. This piece is based on an 8th century sculpture in the collection of Shorinji Temple in Nara. ",
