  "text": "These chatty trees, grazed with yellow pastel, reflect Auguste Lepère’s delight in Saint-Jean-de-Monts, the French coastal town where he spent summers after 1892. Before the widespread use of photo-based illustrations, Lepère produced precise wood engravings for Parisian magazines. In the countryside he showed more abandon, as seen in the loose pencil underdrawing here. Minute by minute the blue-hued shadow moves across the yellow field, soon to engulf the unsuspecting trees.
