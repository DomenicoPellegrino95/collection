  "text": "As a key figure in the development of American Impressionism, Richard Miller began his career as a member of the well-known Giverny Colony of American Impressionists in France, a group that drew inspiration from that other famous resident of Giverny, Claude Monet. Miller was primarily a figurative painter, known for his paintings of comely young women posing languidly in interiors or outdoor settings. His work is best described as Decorative Impressionism, distinguished by its monumentality, its strong sense of design, and its vivid color contrasts.",
