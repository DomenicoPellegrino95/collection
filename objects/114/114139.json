  "text": "This dynamically carved, small <I>nkisi</I> would have been used as a power figure for healing and protection in a family compound. It is charged with sacred and efficacious substances, considered to act like \"medicine\"-one of the meanings of the word <I>nkisi</I>. These substances are hidden in the crown of the head, the collar around the neck, the box on the abdomen, and the pack between the legs. The mirrors on the head and the abdomen suggest the surface of water that separates the world of the living and that of the spirits; they allow the <I>nkisi</I> to \"see\" what is hidden and ward off evil forces.",
