  "text": "Palombo is best remembered for his monumental architectural sculptures, the doors to the Hall of Remembrance at Yad Vashem and the entrance gates to the Israeli Knesset. This Hanukkah lamp is sculpture as much as it is a functional object. Rather than using rich materials and decorative stylistic elements, the simple iron surface is blackened and rough. The jagged terminals of the candlesticks look dangerous, and the course welds bind the piece together like rivets on shackles. Rather than simply rejoicing in in the Festival of Lights, Palombo also reminds us of those lost to the Holocaust.",
