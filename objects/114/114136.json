  "text": "How do you usher the soul of the dead into the Otherworld' On the island of New Ireland, part of Papua New Guinea, the community holds a malagan festival, where a dancer dons this mask depicting the spirit of the deceased. The complex festival, held several months or even years after a funeral, features feasting, the resolution of disputes, and masquerades—an attempt to maintain the social order and networks for interdependence. The mask, its eyes made from a snail’s shell, is worn atop the head such that the dancer peers out from beneath the chin.",
