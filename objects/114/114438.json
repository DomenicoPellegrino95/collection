  "text": "This figure is displayed among musical instruments because, surprisingly, it is one. Adorned with armlets, a hat, and an amulet around the neck, it was traditionally carried in funeral processions for important elders and either rocked to the rhythm of accompanying instruments or pounded on the ground to create its own rhythm. Even its overall posture has a kind of rhythm and dynamism.",
