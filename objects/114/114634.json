  "text": "Rachel Whiteread is best known for her cast sculptures of negative spaces, the areas occupied or defined by ordinary domestic objects and architectural structures, from tables, chairs, sinks, and fixtures to stairways, rooms, and even entire houses, Typically composed of industrial materials, her casts explore the complex emotional relationships between architectural spaces and the rich, but often hidden realm of our personal lives. \r\n\r\nWhiteread's cast doorknob is a soft and malleable version of an earlier solid white plaster sculpture she made as part of her monumental environment \"Transient Spaces.\" Made from Techogel, a supple black gel used for cushioning applications in the medical and furniture industries, the doorknob multiple can be stretched and distorted, but then slowly returns to its original form.\r\n",
