  "text": "The designers of Kuba textiles, traditionally women, are driven by technical skill, patience, and creativity. And the experimentation and innovation comes through in their strikingly original works. These three panels are constructed entirely from raffia palm fiber; the two smaller panels are embroidered in a technique that mimics woven velvet. Thousands of tiny stitches are looped and cut to create a dense, raised texture. The panel at the lower left, not yet complete, reveals the time-consuming process.\r\nThe larger of the three panels is embellished with appliqu√©d shapes. Several panels are joined together, perhaps the start of a larger project. Many Kuba textiles are joined in this way to form 12-feet-long'or longer'cloths, which are wrapped around a woman's body to form a layered skirt.",
