  "text": "In the 1920s, Matisse made a series of beautiful lithographs of women. He intensely studied his models, their clothes, and their surroundings. He repeatedly drew individual details of each motif until he had such command that he could capture its essence in the simplest, quick, and graceful line. The results were so pleasing to the eye that is former compatriots in the 20th century's artistic revolution felt betrayed, but the public loved it.\r\n \r\nOnlookers assumed that Matisse had a series of debauched affairs with his models. This was not the case. He said that he would not touch his models, just as he would not eat a fish arranged for a still-life. His nudes are, as he said, filled with sublimated erotic charge.",
