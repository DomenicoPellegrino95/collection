  "text": "Form Pink #54, with its tiny mouth, is an example of the simplified, enclosed form that became a hallmark in Takaezu’s ceramics. It contains a rattle—usually a small ceramic piece--which she typically incorporated into such vessels. Notably, she improvised pouring and hand painting the surface, in contrast to her methodical form. Lone Spouted Bowl was likely created around the time she visited her parents’ native Japan in 1955, and its broadly-brushed decoration references Japanese calligraphy.",
