  "text": "At the center of Abelam ritual life were very large spirit houses that were reserved for men. Most Abelam paintings and sculptures-characterized by strong colors and taut forms-were found in and around these buildings. One of their main functions was to teach initiates, through association and introspection, the history of the clan and the origin of the world.\r\n\r\nThis large figure of an ancestor spirit is hollow on the back and contains holes all around, indicating that it was once attached to a spirit house pole. Its base is eroded from long-term usage. The many animals and symbols allude to clan ancestors and mythical beings. Above the large head are two figures on either side, one of which represents a woman giving birth, a common theme in Abelam art.\r\n",
