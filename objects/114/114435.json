  "text": "Iraqw skirts are among the most dynamic examples of Eastern African beadwork. In the past, Iraqw girls dressed in a plain leather cloak until they reached puberty. At that point, they transformed their drab garment into a colorful skirt to be worn on special occasions. Besides serving as an artistic expression of her new identity as a young woman, the process of skirt-making was a chance to show off her sewing proficiency and aesthetic tastesâ€”qualities that suitors might look for in a potential wife.",
