  "text": "In a sense, this Yoruba mask embodies a double performance. As part of a dancer’s outfit, it would appear in the Gelede festival honoring “Mothers”—the living and deceased women of a community. Gelede both celebrates and appeases their power, which may be used for good or evil. At the same time, the sculptor demonstrated his virtuosity by carving two superimposed faces that perfectly match, which may be a reference to Yoruba concepts of inner and outer being. Onlookers would have admired the achievements of dancer and maker alike.",
