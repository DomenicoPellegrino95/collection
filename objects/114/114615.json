  "text": "American sculptor Mark di Suvero is widely recognized for his powerful large-scale \r\nabstract sculptures made from welded steel beams, metal plates, and scrap industrial materials. Some of the sculptures are stationary; others are designed to be kinetic, incorporating parts that can move freely in space. Di Suveroâ€™s work is grounded in abstract expressionism, conveying emotion through line, color, material, and most importantly, the active engagement of space. Rising (for Walt Whitman) is a small-scale exploration of these ideas, where variable spatial and formal relationships provide a conceptually nuanced work of art that invites close inspection. ",
