  "text": "Note the miniature slit gong, decorated with a small head, hanging from this figureâ€™s waist. The actual instrument would have been played by healers and diviners of the Khosi association to invoke the assistance of certain spirits. Khosi was an esoteric institution among the Yaka and their neighbors, concerned with healing, protection from evil, and also cursing others. Its typical colors were white and red, as seen on the faces of both the figure and the mini-gong.",
