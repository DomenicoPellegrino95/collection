  "text": "From a series of prints about the weather, Gillray's Very Slippy Weather features the print shop of his exclusive publisher, Hannah Humphrey, at 27 St. James's Street, where Gillray lived and kept a studio. Among Mrs. Humphrey's clients was the Prince of Wales, himself the target of a number of devastating caricatures by Gillray. The prince nonetheless bought 121 prints from Humphrey's shop in one year. No one was spared ridicule in Gillray's world. Here his regular clientele is amusingly scorned, portrayed rather grotesquely gawking at the prints displayed in the shop window while a round clergyman inside considers purchasing an anti-papist print Gillray had executed a few years prior.",
