  "text": "Conrad Gesner attempted to compile all knowledge, both ancient and modern, of animals both real and less so. He relied on texts, painted images, actual sightings, specimens, and other remains. From a modern perspective, it may seem curious that he included so many Wild Things, but living in the Age of Discovery, he was highly aware that the unbelievable might turn out to be true.",
