  "text": "The Jean de Bry coat was all the rage in 1799. This double-breasted garment made of thick fabric and lining had a high stand-fall collar, greatly padded sleeves and shoulders, and short, scant tails. It was named for Jean-Antoine-Joseph de Bry, a French revolutionary leader. The Gentlemanâ€™s Magazine reported that such a coat had saved his life during a riot. His attackers dealt him fifty blows with knives and swords, only one penetrated his coat to harm him.",
