She left her husband and moved to Holland, where she became fascinated by the exotic creatures that arriving from its far-flung trade routes. In 1699, the city of Amsterdam sponsored her voyage to the colony of Surinam so that she could study its natural bounty. After malaria forced her to return home, she published magnificent illustrations of insects and their habitat.",
