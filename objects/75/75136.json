  "text": "Before writing “The Owl and the Pussycat” and other “Nonsense” verse, Edward Lear had a brief, brilliant career as a zoological draftsman. He challenged the rules of scientific illustration by giving his subjects personality, evident in this plate for John Gould’s The Birds of Europe. The female looks off demurely while her mate is self-possessed and insouciant. A more precision-minded illustrator would have delineated the owl’s legs, which have the thickest feathering of any bird in North America.",
