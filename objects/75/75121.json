  "text": "The scene is a drawing room, the room for entertaining guests, in the court sense held at the Queen's House (now Buckingham Palace). If not in uniform, the men wear court-suits with gold lace and bag-wigs which gathered their back hair in black silk bags tied with a ribbon. In 1818, the year of this caricature, Lady Susan O'Brien lamented the state of the modern drawing rooms: “The crowds are so great & so little decorum attended to, that people's clothes are literally torn to pieces.” It appears that Mr. Cruikshank made a similar observation but took it with delight.",
