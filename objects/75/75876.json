  "text": "Ruysch invented a solution to preserve human organs and other organic material. He kept specimens in jars whose lids were topped with dioramas of natural—or natural-looking—objects, that often alluded to the contents. In the example illustrated in this etching, the dubious-looking coral branches on the top were actually hardened blood vessels, dyed coral-red. Despite their educational intent, these arrangements crossed the boundaries between science and showmanship. ",
