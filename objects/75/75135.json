  "text": "After the death of James Gillray in 1815, George Cruikshank appropriated the idea \"Monstrosities of 1799\", and turned it into an annual series lampooning contemporary fashion. In 1821, women were not the only ones to parade their wasp-like waistlines. Men, boys, and poodles also went in for outsized headgear and narrow ankles. A grenadier wears an enormous bearskin hat, an honor bestowed on his regiment for its valor in the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo.",
