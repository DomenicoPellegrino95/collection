  "text": "Texas Longhorn cattle were plentiful in the late 19th century. Raised and prized for beef and hide, their horns were discarded. Furniture maker Wenzel Friedrich, a German immigrant, resourced the horns in local stockyards to create this chair. Increased consumption of the cattle led to near extinction by 1927, when the federal government began conservation efforts. The upholstery of the rocker and stool are ocelot, what  Friedrich referred to as “jaguar”, and which are currently endangered. ",
