  "text": "This mandala is a representation of the Western Pure Land, the paradise of the Buddha Amida, the most important Buddha of the Pure Land sect of Buddhism. Amida appears at the very center of the mandala flanked by his attendants, the bodhisattvas Kannon and Seishi. Enthroned within a vast palatial setting, they are surrounded by a retinue of dozens of other celestials. This type of mandala, now commonly known as a “Taima Mandala,” was introduced to Japan from China along with Pure Land Buddhist teachings in the eighth century. The earliest Japanese example, a massive hand-woven tapestry, belongs to the Pure Land temple Taimadera, from which the name of the iconographic type is derived.",
