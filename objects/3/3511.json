  "text": "Very little is known about the English silver designer Kate Harris, although powerful works such as this presentation cup suggest her talents deserve more attention.  Her metalwork designs incorporate flowing lines and organic motifs of the Art Nouveau style as well as the grounded sensibility associated with the Arts and Crafts movement.  Harris provided a number of designs to William Hutton and Sons, who supplied silver to the progressive London department store Liberty and Co. The November 1901 issue of <I>International Studio<I> magazine illustrates this very piece without its lid, which may have been added at a later date.",
