  "text": "Mary of Egypt had been a prostitute, known widely for her strong sexual desires before she suddenly repented and became a hermit in the desert. Much like Mary Magdalen, after resisting all worldly temptations she was able to ascend to heaven which might account for the confusion of their stories. Here, the long, disheveled hair covering Mary of Egypt’s body represents her rejection of feminine sensuality despite her former beauty. ",
