  "text": "Unrecognizable as the Art Deco landmark now housing the Today Show and Saturday Night Live, Rockefeller Center is under construction in Abbott’s image, which focuses on scale and steel. What you don’t see is the precarious perch that Abbott used, standard practice for photographers documenting the skyline and construction sites at a time before safety harnesses and hardhats. \r\n \r\nJust a few years later, Abbott was hired by the Federal Art Project (FAP) of the Works Progress Administration to continue what she had been doing freelance—creating a broad record of the modernization of New York City. The FAP work was published in conjunction with the 1939 New York World’s Fair as Changing New York. ",
