  "text": "The affection shown here between Mary and the Christ Child emphasizes Christ's humanity - a stylistic departure from traditional medieval depictions. The comparatively informal and naturalistic portrayal of the figures reflects a desire for a more personal association with God, fostered in the 13th century by the teachings of Saint Francis of Assisi.\r\n\r\nThe Madonna was the object of intense popular devotion in early 14th century Italy. In Siena, where this devotional image was made, she was venerated as the patron saint and protectress of the city. Originally, the central panel of a polyptych, or multipart altarpiece, this Madonna and Child probably had two half-length images of saints on either side.",
