  "text": "The technique of inlaying lacquer with mother-of-pearl dates from the Shang dynasty (12th-11th century BCE). By the Yuan and Ming periods, hundreds of tiny pieces of thin shell were combined to create complicated pictorial scenes like the landscape illustrated here. The technique remained popular through the eighteenth century and was adopted by craftsmen on the Ryuku Islands (Okinawa) where native shells were particularly beautiful.",
