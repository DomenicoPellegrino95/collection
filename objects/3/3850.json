  "text": "Made from the standard orange earthenware body of Han green glazed tomb models, this miniature milling station features a circular millstone and a foot-operated mortar and pestle grain pounder under its shed roof. Both of these farm tools can still be seen in use throughout rural China. Han tombs provide an abundance of agricultural models reflecting the belief that agriculture was fundamental to the prosperity of the country.",
