  "text": "A cunning monkey persuades a cat to retrieve roasting chestnuts from a fire. It's a scene from Jean de La Fontaine's 17th-century fable that spawned the term \"cat's paw\"â€”someone unwittingly duped by another. But the cold brutality of the image is not in keeping with the original illustrations of his stories, created a couple centuries before the Romantic painters and satirists of the 1800s revived La Fontaine's use of animal antics to symbolize human struggles.",
