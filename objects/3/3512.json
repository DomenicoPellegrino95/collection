Built from coils of clay, the vessel relates in shape to the earlier Panshan (2600-2300 b.c.) jars shown here, but its proportions are more elongated and its surface is matt and unburnished. Related Mazhang (2200-2000 b.c.) type jars have been excavated in Gansu and Qinghai provinces in northwest China.",
