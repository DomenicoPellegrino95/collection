  "text": "The subject of a craze that has lasted for centuries, China's signature blue and white porcelain came about as a tremendous technical breakthrough in the fourteenth century. This pear-shaped bottle, or (<I>ping</I>), stands near the beginning of this prized, long-popular tradition. Encircling the body of the vase is a spikey, three-clawed dragon painted in underglaze cobalt blue. In order to depict the dragon, cobalt blue designs were painted onto the white porcelain body and then bonded under a clear feldspathic glaze.  ",
