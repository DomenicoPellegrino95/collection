  "text": "In parts of Guatemala, highly decorative blouses like this one were worn over the skirt and without a belt for celebratory occasions such as a wedding. This elaborately patterned woman's blouse (huipil) was constructed from three separately woven four selvedge panels. It took a great deal of time and considerable skill to make. In a society where weaving skills are highly valued, such as highland Guatemala, this blouse would be very much admired and appreciated by all who saw it and would have special significance for the woman wearing it.",
