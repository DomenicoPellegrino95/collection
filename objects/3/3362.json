  "text": "This elegant box is decorated with scenes from the life of St. Nicholas of Myra. He was a fourth century Greek bishop who has become the patron saint of children, sailors and travelers, the guardian of young women, and forerunner of St. Nicholas or Father Christmas. \r\n\r\nThe gold scenes on this box were applied in a <i>piqué<i> technique whereby thin sheets of gold are impressed into tortoiseshell that has been softened in boiling water and olive oil. Once the tortoiseshell cools, it contracts, and the gold is securely held in place. This technique was first introduced at the end of the sixteenth century in Naples, and by the following century it had spread to France, England, and northern Europe, with Paris and Naples as the principal centers.
