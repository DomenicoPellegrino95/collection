  "text": "The form of this clock depicts two vestal virgins, with costumes and hairstyles inspired by classical antiquity, carrying an altar with the sacred fire.  The base, supported by panthers, is decorated with a frieze of putti playing and two plaques depicting Clio, muse of history, and Urania, muse of astronomy.\r\n\r\nThe design of the clock is taken from an engraving by the painter Hubert Robert, published in 1771-73. The collection of Robert's engravings was dedicated to the queen of France, Marie-Antoinette, and an almost identical clock, made by Pierre-Philippe Thomire, was made for the queen's bathroom in the Tuileries in Paris.",
