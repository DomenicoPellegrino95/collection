  "text": "The Quechua of the Potolo region are one of the few Andean cultures who altered their textile aesthetic during the twentieth century.  The integral quality of the cloth remained an important factor, but the placement of the pattern changed from being aligned and well ordered to being more spontaneous and creative. They also began to integrate phantasmagorical creatures such as dragons and other winged figures into their designs. ",
