  "text": "The interior of this thinly potted conical bowl has a finely incised design of two boys clambering amidst stylized peony blooms and feathery sprays of foliage encircled by a plain rim border. Children, especially sons, and peonies were auspicious emblems to the Chinese and they are common motifs in Sung dynasty (960-1279) decorative art. This finely executed bowl has a low straight foot and a translucent white body covered with a blue glaze typical of late Northern Sung ware from Chiang-te-chen kilns like those at Hu-tian. Some suggest that this type of conical bowl was used for tea drinking but, given its large size, it is more accurate to see its function as that of a standard food bowl.",
