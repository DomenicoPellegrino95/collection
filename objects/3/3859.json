  "text": "Liu Tu was a pupil of the last Che school master, Lan Ying (1585-1664), also shown in this gallery. Both artists worked in Hang chou. Liu was an important professional painter, skilled in many formats and accomplished in painting in the styles of the old masters. His favorites were Li Ch'ing (919-967) whose influence can be seen here in the bare trees, and Chao Meng-fu (1254-1322). The theme of this painting, the \"Road to Shu,\" is an historical reference to the temporary collapse of the Tang court in the 8th century and the emperor Ming-huang's self-imposed exile to the distant state of Shu (Szechwan province). Liu's colophon states that the painting was dedicated to the Taoist elder Ch'io-chai and that he was influenced in this work by the ideas of Yuan dynasty painters (14th century). \r\n<P>The first of five colophons following the painting was written by the scholar P'an I-chun (1740-1830), it reads in part: \r\n\r\n<P><I>The T'ang poet Li Po wrote \"the Road to Shu is\r\ndifficult,\" every time one reads it, it makes a man\r\nsigh, exclaim at its precipitousness and be afraid\r\nto travel there. . . how could he not sigh at the\r\ndifficulties of expressing all this in a painting. . .<I>",
