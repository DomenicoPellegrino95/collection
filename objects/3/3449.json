  "text": "Abbott’s documentation of Changing New York, as her later project was called, included both old and new architecture, often shot from exciting and dramatic angles. Her high vantage point on the Flatiron Building reinforces the iconic status it held in the 1930s. Named for its triangular shape (the non-electric irons of the time were called flatirons), it was one of the defining buildings of modern New York and one of only two skyscrapers in the city when it was built in 1902.
