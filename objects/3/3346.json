  "text": "Working in Newcastle-on-Tyne, the Beilby family is credited with introducing to England the process of enameling colorless glass.  William and his sister Mary were the most skilled enamellers in the family.  Their decoration varied from heraldic motifs and armorials to architectural ruins and pastoral landscapes framed in Rococo cartouches.  The light, fluid quality of the Rococo style is conveyed in this goblet through the enamel design on the bowl and in the air-twist stem.",
