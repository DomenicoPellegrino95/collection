  "text": "The Eames Storage Units (ESUs) were a flexible, low-cost system of storage and display. Consumers customized the ESUs with different combinations of drawers, shelves, and sliding panels (the latter used on this buffet). The Eameses' use of industrial materials conveyed a modern aesthetic, while vividly colored Masonite added a touch of playfulness to the product.  The ESUs were a good foil to the complex curves of the Eameses' chairs, and perfect for open-plan modern homes. However, they had some design challenges, such as the delicate steel-angle legs seen on this early example, which were replaced with a sturdier leg with a triangular support in later versions. Original production on the storage units dated from 1950-55, although Herman Miller introduced a re-issue in the 1990s.",
