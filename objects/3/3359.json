  "text": "An obsessive angler, Dwight William Tryon kept a log of which trout fly to use every day of the year. By contrast, he gave himself just one subject for most of his mature artistic career: a stand of trees. These were tall, immaterial forms that evoked nature’s different moods. Tryon achieved poetic feeling in his pastels by an unlikely means: he built them up by alternating layers of fixative and color. The technique, evident in this sheet’s rather scumbled look, helps turn a New England meadow into an object of meditation.",
