Feudal lords and the shogun's guards used riding equipment ornamented in a manner appropriate to their social position. This pair of stirrups is sumptuously decorated with designs of blossoming wisteria. According to the inlaid inscription on each of the buckle-brackets, the stirrups were made by the metalsmith Kuniyuki, who worked in the town of Kanagawa in Kashu province (modern-day Ishikawa prefecture).",
