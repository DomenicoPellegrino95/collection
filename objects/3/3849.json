  "text": "The cover of this jar depicts sacred mountains populated with animals of Han mythology, mainly dragons, tigers and bears. Around the main register is a landscape scene with hunters on horseback pursuing wild animals. <I>Lien<I> jars were used to store small items, especially cosmetics. The mountain peaks seen here and on the <I>po-shan-lu<I> censer are inspired by popular Taoism and its fixation on immortality.",
