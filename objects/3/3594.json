  "text": "The sitter in this portrait is a woman of significant status and most likely connected to the English court or royal household. She wears a French hood on her head, one indication of her high social standing. On the bodice of her dress is an elaborate gold brooch. The scene on the brooch is that of a seated woman playing what appears to be a lute. The white scroll around this woman is inscribed, Praise the Lorde for ever more. Brooches, among other types of jewelry, were very popular with members of the upper classes. The sitter also holds a portable prayer book encased in gold. Only the wealthier classes could afford to purchase such expensive girdle books. Among the ladies of the court, these prayer books were very much a symbol of status and wealth.",
