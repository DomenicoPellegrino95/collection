  "text": "Dou used a magnifying glass and very fine brushes to aid his emulation of Rembrandt's early style, in which precisely rendered details are bathed in mysterious light. A specialist in genre subjects, Dou was best known in his lifetime for representations of penitents and hermits that contained numerous references to age, mortality, and transience.",

A replica exists which went up for auction at Christie's, October 1990, which has a provenance since 1887. Many early bibliographies on Dou reference this painting, mistaking it for the [MIA] original.  The work arrived at Trafalgar through an \"English provincial sale\", with no other source information provided.\r\n\r\n",
