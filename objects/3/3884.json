Their design, with oval backs incoporating Prince of Wales feathers, derives from the pattern book of George Hepplewhite, <I>The Cabinetmaker and Upholsterer's Guide</I>, first published in London in 1788.  Their overall painted decoration mirrored a fashionable treatment for furniture first popularized in England by Robert Adams and James Wyatt in the 1760s and 1770s.",
