  "text": "A large group of bowls and dishes of this type are known, most decorated with a single large lotus flower and leaf of similar design. Besides the northern celadon kiln complex at Yaozhou in Shansi province, a number of other northern Song kiln sites have been discovered including Linru in Henan province. The type of clay body and blue-green glaze seen here suggest Linru as the likely source for this bowl.",
