  "text": "A large group of bowls and dishes of this type are known, most decorated with a single large lotus flower and leaf of similar design. Besides the northern celadon kiln complex at Yao-chou in Shansi province, a number of other northern Sung kiln sites have been discovered including Lin-ju in Honan province. The type of clay body and blue-green glaze seen here suggest Lin-ju as the likely source for this bowl.",
