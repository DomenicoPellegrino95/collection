  "text": "Japanese artists of the sixteenth century developed a dazzling style which made use of abstract compositions, opulent colors, and metalic foils. This pair of screens epitomizes this mode. The artist was inspired by classical poetry in which the phrase <I>tagasode</I> (Whose Sleeves') refers to the long, elegant sleeves of aristocratic women's beautiful robes. Rather than depicting sumptously gowned women, the artist created an astonishingly modern composition by arranging the geometric shapes of their folded kimono and lacquered garment racks against a diagonally divided background of gold leaf and sprinkled gold and silver flakes. The careful rendering of textile patterns suggests the keen interest in fashion among the wealthy merchant class during Japan's Edo period.",
