  "text": "This exquisitely rendered depiction of a lotus was originally part of an assembled album, or muraqqa. Between approximately 1600 and 1660, Mughal painters concentrated on perfecting techniques of naturalism. Because Hindu paintings were not considered \"proper\" vehicles for expressing the new interest in naturalism for the Mughal court, Persian works and European prints became appropriate models. This carefully drawn lotus, for instance, exhibits a remarkable concern for accurate shading and detail which, along with its still-life effect, owes more to European engravings of botanical studies than to any classical Indian tradition.",
