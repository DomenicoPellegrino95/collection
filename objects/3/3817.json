  "text": "In the past, diviners among the Tabwa were possessed by spirits, which enabled them to seek explanations and cures for illness and other misfortunes. This process of enlightenment was called 'the rising of the moon,' an expression referring to the dawning of light and hope after a period of darkness. The Tabwa graphically rendered this concept as a succession of dark and light interlocking triangles, a prominent motif in their art and also visible on this diviner's mask.",
