  "text": "To get this dramatic night shot of lit-up offices, Abbott needed a 15-minute film exposure. She knew that most people left their offices at 5 p.m., turning their lights off when they left. The only night that it would be dark enough before 5 p.m. to create enough contrast between the building lights and the night sky was the shortest day of the year—December 20. Abbott also knew that wind would shake the camera over such a long exposure and blur her picture. So she found a building with the perfect view and got permission from the landlord to use a window. At sunset on December 20, 1934, Abbott got her picture.",
