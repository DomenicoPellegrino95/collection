  "text": "This large figure holds an instrument called <i>katoviso</i>, which comprises a group of bamboo pipes that are played by blowing across the top. The piper's rain hat, made of a pandan leaf, is typical for women. The stylized snake carvings that compose the skirt represent the woman's connection to the spiritual world. Serpents appear frequently in the art of New Ireland because of their supernatural powers. This figure likely portrays a clan ancestor for whom a <i>malagan</i> ceremony was held.",
