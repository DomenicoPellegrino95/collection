  "text": "Although blue-and-white patterns in ceramics are associated with China, Islamic potters were the first to use cobalt-blue decoration. When commercial ties to China were reestablished during the fourteenth century, fine ceramics imported from the Far East, particularly blue-and-white, became extremely popular and greatly affected subsequent Islamic styles. This outstanding example from the Safavid period (1502-1722) is closely related to Chinese porcelains of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). The foliate rim, tendril design of the cavetto, animal motif in the center, and continuous scroll bands all vaguely refer to Chinese designs.",
