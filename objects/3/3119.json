  "text": "Japan's first ceramic culture, the Jo_mon, produced strongly tactile pottery over 3,500 years ago. This lavishly decorated bowl was probably used during religious ceremonies. Its flamboyant rim, a typical feature of Middle Jo_mon pottery, is known as the \"fire-flame\" type (<I>ka'en-shiki<I>), because the coils of clay resemble leaping flames. The word jo_mon, after which the period is named, means \"cord markings,\" and derives from the distinctive patterns produced by rolling a rope-wrapped stick across the surface of wet clay. The lower portion of this vessel bears these markings, together with incised whimsical designs.",
