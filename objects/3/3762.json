  "text": "A solitary scholar in a skiff drifts periodically between blossoming plum trees while enjoying his view of mountain peaks emerging from the pervasive river mist. The subject reveals a retreat from stark reality, the world is idealized and the gentle scene is suggested rather than described in full. Terse brushwork and modulated washes almost reduce the mountains to incorporeal silhouettes. It is a lyrical mood painting typical of Southern Sung (1127-1278) painting in the style of Ma Yuan (active 1189-1225) and Hsia Kuei (active 1180-1224). These artists and others in their lineage moved away from the Northern Sung (960-1126) depictions of monumental, naturalistic landscapes to small scale works such as fans and album leaves full of subtle atmospheric effects condensed into brief intense moments of experienced time. The shift was from descriptive to more impressionistic brushwork underscoring the ideal that a painting should capture the essential spirit of the subject rather than accurately describe it.",
