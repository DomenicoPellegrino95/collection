  "text": "The Moche people of the northern coast of Peru produced hundreds of ceramic vessels depicting copulation. The ceramics vary in shape, decoration, and subject. This is an example of the most common scene: a square stirrup vessel showing a male and female engaged in anal copulation, with an infant at the breast of the female. Such vessels were offerings buried in tombs, and it is believed that the significance of certain sexual acts may have been related to Moche funerary ritual.",
