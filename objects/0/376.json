  "text": "The god Shiva appears here as Nataraja, or Lord of the Dance. He raises his left foot aloft in a graceful dance pose, while holding destructive fire and a drum in his two upper hands. A now missing ring of fire would have encircled him. This magnificent ceremonial bronze would have been kept in the sacred central sanctum of a temple near to Pondicherry in Tamil Nadu, southeastern India. In 1929, it became the MIAâ€™s first acquisition of South Asian art.",
