  "text": "Queen Artemisia and her son, Lygdamis, kneel before a marble altar asking God's blessing before Lygdamis is crowned king. The high priest pours wine over the sacrificial bull while trios of children sing songs of praise. Behind the queen regent and her son are courtiers and attendants.\r\n\r\nIn 17th century France, religious feeling ran high. This scene was meant to convey the commitment of queen regent Marie de' Medici and her son Louis XIII to continuing the French Catholic state and also to inspire viewers by the example of their rulers' faith.\r\n\r\nFrom the Stories of Queen Artemisia series",
