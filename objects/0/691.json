  "description": "Seated female figure, legs missing, wearing a short apron-like garment terminating at the knees. Upper body clothed in a laced jerkin suggested by applied rolls of clay. Wide bands of clay form a turban headdress and wristlets. A thick roll of clay with ball pendant makes the necklace and a ball of clay serves as a nose ornament. There are traces of painted bands around the eye sockets, and around the slit mouth. Ear plugs and rings. The hands, resting on knees, are sketchily modeled. Restored at neck.",
