  "text": "The series from which this tapestry derives is titled <i>Grotesques</i> in reference to its composition type. Grotesque scenes typically incorporated fanciful combinations of strange characters and imaginary hybrid creatures intended to delight the viewer. The disparate elements were unified by a symmetrical design of slender architectural features and scrolling ribbons and vines that seem illogically suspended in midair or applied to a flat surface. \r\n \r\nThis scene features exotic animals – a camel, peacock, leopard, and parrots – as well as a group of performers assembled for the pleasure of a king seated on a throne to the right. One concession to the “otherworldly” nature of grotesques can be seen in the sphinx beside the king and harp player.   ",
