  "text": "Deep wrinkles, tired eyes, and haggard cheeks are prominent features of the Paduan lawyer Luca Salvioni. Renaissance humanism, with its belief in the importance of the individual, led many sculptors to model their style on Roman busts of the Republican era, which also employed detailed naturalism to carefully document the sitter’s facial features. But the scrolled tablet below the bust, which in ancient Rome originated to record the sitter’s name, is here turned into a design element. In an unprededented way it is stretched like taffy to literally underline the composition.",
