  "description": "Bowl, wide-mouthed wit slightly constricted neck, painted in polychrome. The decoration occupies two bands, set off from each other by a glyph* border about two-thirds of the way up the body. The lower band is divided into six panels, three of which contain seated personages elaborately dressed and carrying ceremonial objects in the left hand. These panels, painted brick red and black on a pale orange ground, alternate with fluted panels, painted brick red. The upper band is decorated with a line of seated personages wearing peaked turbans and separated one form the other by serpent and feathered motifs. The colors repeat those of the lower band. Inside the rim is a wide band of pale orange with a line of stylized heads with towering, paddle-shaped headdresses. Restored. * Glyphs are pseudo-glyphs",
