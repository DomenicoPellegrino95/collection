  "description": "A vivid impression of life and movement is achieved by the schematic treatment of the legs, the ponderous body, and the summarily modelled head. The eyes, under flat, curving horns, are extraordinarily expressive. the incised decor of the body, with thin, slanting lines arranged in rows or grouped around a circular motif, stems from an earlier element that appears on the legs and throat of the early Middle Chou figure of a buffalo (Karlgren, Plates 102, 103). The socket on the beast's back indicates that the animal has served as a podium. The body is hollow and open, with traces of clay inside the belly. Patina grey-green.",
