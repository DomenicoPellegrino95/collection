  "text": "A dalmatic is the outer liturgical vestment worn by a deacon during Mass and other church services.  Based on a Roman garment in general use in the province of Dalmatia in the 3rd century, the dalmatic was adapted by senators in Rome as a sign of their rank.  Christian deacons began wearing the dalmatic during the reign of Pope Sylvester (315-335 A.D.).  \r\n\r\nThe richly ornamented embroidery on this vestment, called orphrey, characterizes liturgical vestments made in 16th century Spain. The roundel on one side contains a depiction of the Madonna and Child and St. John the Baptist, and on the other, St. John the Baptist as an adult with his traditional attributes of a pilgrim's staff and a lamb.\r\nThe double presence of this saint suggests this dalmatic was made for a church that fostered a particular devotion to him.\r\n",
