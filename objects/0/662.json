  "text": "This magnificent curtain served as a backdrop to the throne in one of the main audience halls of the Forbidden City. Woven into its surface are nine imperial dragons within the celestial landscape symbolizing the emperor and the court just as they do in semiformal robes. Measuring nearly seventeen by twenty-five feet, this is the largest known hanging of its kind, a splendid testament to the scale and opulence of the Ch'ien-lung court (1736-95)",
  "description": "Large curtain hanging of imperial yellow brocaded satin. Design of nine large five-clawed dragons in gold in a field of loose clouds. Below, the Eternal Sea, with symbols in the waves. At the top, a deep, pleated valance on which appear small gold dragons and clouds. Two loose strips of the same design, hang down the front of the main curtain. An imperial piece of superb quality. Lining in gold-colored damask of cloud design.",
