  "text": "Born in Iowa, Dawes worked in Minneapolis from 1892 to 1913, the year he painted this image of an open-water channel curving through the mostly frozen Mississippi River toward Minneapolis’s flour mills—today’s Mill City Museum. He used an Impressionist technique to make the mills appear hazy in the distance and he also appears to have taken some liberties with the actual topography. But the mills’ monumentality, especially compared to the passing train along the shoreline, alludes to the progress and prosperity of the increasingly industrialized cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, as seen in the photo below.
