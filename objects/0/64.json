  "text": "This tapestry is a fragment of a larger hanging that depicts ladies and gentlemen hunting with falcons. It shows various phases in the training and exercise of the birds, as well as the manner and dress of the nobility who enjoyed this social sport.&lt:P&gt;During the fifteenth century many tapestry designers indicated perspective by arranging various scenes one above the other. The figures near the bottom of the piece are meant to be in the foreground, closer to the viewer, while the scenes near the top are more distant.&lt;P&gt;",
