  "description": "Small totem of carved slate ? with carefully finished surface. The upper animal is a bear squatting with his fore-paws under his chin; he is identified by his protruding tongue, large round nose and sudden turn from nose to fore-head; his ears are missing. The lower animal seems also to be a bear, squatting with his tail turned up in front behind his hind legs. He is swallowing some being the legs and hands of which hang out of this mouth; he is grasping the lower legs with his fore-paws. The difference between this bear and the upper one is due to the fact that his forehead is farther foward so that the other bear can perch on his head. This necessitates the spine in the middle of his nose to indicate the sharp turn from nose to forehead. late 19th century.",
