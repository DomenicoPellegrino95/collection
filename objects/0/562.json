  "text": "The leading centers of American cabinetmaking in the eighteenth century were Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, and Newport, Rhode Island. Each city, and the surrounding region, produced furniture distinct from other places through the choice of secondary wood types, construction techniques, and the appearance of carved and applied decoration. The famous cabinetmakers from the Goddard and Townsend families of Newport are credited with making dozens of exceptional late-baroque, rococo, and early-neoclassical pieces of furniture. \r\nOn this table, the highly figured mahogany surface, crisp lines of the cabriole legs, and undulating rails and tables leaves with sqaure corners and cyma curves, are all characteristics of Newport furniture and particularly those objects produced by the Townsend-Goddard school. The juxtaposition of fashionable ball-and-claw front feet with less costly rear pad feet suggests that this sculptural object was originally intended to be seen from the front when not in use. ",
