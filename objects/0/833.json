  "description": "Kuei without handles. The vessel is divided into four vertical panels by heavy flanges with alternate straight and T-shaped scores. In two places in the neck band the flanges give way to free animals' heads. The features of the bodied t'ao-t'ieh in the main belt are similar to those seen on vessels 50.46.48 and 50.46.86 (Karlgren numbers 7, 11, 30), except that the mouth line is S-shaped and shows the teeth. The dragons in the foot belt have the mouth of the ordinary gaping dragon, but the head turns downward, thus differing slightly from the usual trunked dragon.",

  "text": "Stylized animal motifs predominate Shang bronze decor. The dragon, snake, cicada, ram, owl, tiger and even elephant can all be found. These creatures were almost always subordinate to the taotie mask which typically dominates the largest or most important register of nearly all Shang bronzes. This exquisite food bowl has three such masks clearly cast in high relief encircling its cauldron. Below each mask, in the foot band, are two confronting dragons shown in profile, while four similar dragons appear above each mask in the top decorative band. The exact meaning of the taotie mask to the ancients is unknown, but it undoubtedly held magical powers and protected the sacredness of the vessel and the grave.",
