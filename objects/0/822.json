  "description": "This fantastic creature might be a playful descendant of the water buffalo, Karlgren Number 90 (50.46.113). Here, however, the sculptural effect is achieved through the long sweeping curves of the body. The spirals emphasizing the shoulders and hindquarters are broad bands with a modified scale pattern which recurs on the tail. The shoulder is further emphasized by a raised ring with turquoise inlay. The eyes, with brows of rope pattern, are also inlaid with turquoise. Further elements of the Huai style are the cowrie band around the neck, granulation on the ears and the tufts of the hind legs, and the tail ending in a bird\\'s head. Patina light green.",
