Madame Bally, the last proprietress had 8 children, 6 of them girls and one of these girls was my grandmother on my mother's side.\" A 1995 letter in the curatorial file from Mrs. Marie-Henriette Crouan-Best, states that \"this portrait happens to be my grandmother's grandmother\" and \"the portrait…was owned by my family in France until before the last great war was sold probably around the time by my grandmother, Madame Bally nèe Robin.\"\r\n\r\n[3] According to Wildenstein, 1977, p. 176.\r\n\r\n[4] Invoice in curatorial file dated January 19, 1940.
