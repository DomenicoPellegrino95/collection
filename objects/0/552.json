The surface of the burner is carved with relief floral designs, <I>shou<I> (character for longevity), and a bat, representing good fortune and happiness. The two lower sections of the cover are embellished with similar floral patterns and a serpentine dragon forms the finial while the perforated lid allows for the burning of rare incense.
