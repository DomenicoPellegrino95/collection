  "text": "Cassoni are large wooden chests that became popular during the Italian Renaissance, primarily as bridal presents. Most were made of walnut, and sized to accommodate the clothing, jewelry, carpets, money, and sometimes even weapons included in a bridal dowry. Usually a cassone was kept in the bedroom, where it could also serve as seating.\r\n\r\nThe central decoration of the cassone consists of women representing the four cardinal virtues: Temperance, Justice, Fortitude and Prudence.  These are flanked by a battle between a satyr and a part man, part lion on the left and a woman being kidnapped by a centaur on the right. The raised painted and gilded panel also incorporates family heraldic emblems.",
