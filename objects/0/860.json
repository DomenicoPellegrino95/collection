  "text": "This early stoneware jar does not possess the high translucency of true porcelain. Its form is a product of both native and foreign tradition, but the dynamic contours created by its high shoulders and swollen body are highly characteristic of the Tang Dynasty. Covered with blue lead glaze, this jar may have had an accompanying lid, which has since been lost.",
