  "text": "Pien Wen-yu was born in Suchou where he remained loyal to his artistic roots working with other early seventeenth-century Suchou painters, such as Shao Mi, Sheng Mao-yeh and Ch'en Yuan-su. He became part of the orthodox lineage of artists defined by the great literatus Tung Ch'i-ch'ang and was included as one of the \"Nine Friends of Painting\" by later critics.\r\n<P>The inscription suggest that, by aligning oneself with nature, a person could expect to live a quiet life of peace and tranquility, a sought-after goal during the political and social chaos of the early seventeenth century. It reads in part:\r\n\r\n<P><I>Surrounded by ten-thousand li of water is\r\n<P>white cloud village, amidst the flowers is\r\n<P>built a grass hut;\r\n<P>Evening lotus are reflected in clear pools,\r\n<P>good friends face one another on verandasâ€¦\r\n<P>The river-side mountains are green without end,\r\n<P>and often seem to float in an endless expanse.\r\n\r\n<P>On a summer day in the year 1614, I entrusted (my ideas) to the brush at the Northern Suburb Mountain Cottage. Pien Wen-yu.<I>",
