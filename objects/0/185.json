  "text": "Appearing almost black, a lustrous dark brown glaze covers the interior and exterior of this beautifully formed bowl. The lip is edged in a russet color, and large portions of the body boast radiant patterns of russet markings. The varied glaze finishes result from the use of different iron bearing solutions. The density and color of the clay and type of cut foot indicate that this bowl most likely came from the Kuang-yuan kilns in north-central Szechwan province. The vessel was dipped three times in iron-rich glaze compounds to achieve the beautiful combination of velvety black and brown mottles.",
