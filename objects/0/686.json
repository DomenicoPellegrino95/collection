  "text": "Alonzo Chappel was a New York artist who specialized in historical illustration. His interpretations of the events and heroes of American history presented his late nineteenth-century audiences with a romanticized view of their past. He was especially popular for his depiction of the early history of this country.\r\n\r\nGeneral Francis Marion (1732-1795) began his military career fighting the Cherokee Indians in 1759. Better known as \"The Swamp Fox,\" he became famous for his daring escapades at the head of a guerrilla militia that harangued the British army along the southern frontier during the Revolutionary War.",
