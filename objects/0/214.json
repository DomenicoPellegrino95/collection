  "text": "Théodore Deck's interest and skill in reproducing traditional Persian designs and colors is seen with this vase.  It is decorated in arabic lettering and the vivid turquoise blue color often associated with Isnik wares.  In fact, the form of this vase is inspired by Islamic mosque lamps made in Syria and Egypt during the 14th century.  Ancient objects and motifs from the Middle East proved to be popular sources for decorative objects during the Aesthetic Movement.",
