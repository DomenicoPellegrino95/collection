  "description": "The form of this vessel is the usual broad type with oval section, but the exaggeratedly high collar of the lid, topped by a spherical knob, adds to the impression of height. The decor, disposed in three belts foot, neck, and lid, displays dragons with S-shaped bodies, turned heads, and large S-shaped crests (or horns?). The neck belt is divided in two panels on the long side by a free animal\\'s head, the foot and rim belts by very shallow lines in low relief representing flanges. The handle ends in animals\\' heads with bottle horns. For a discussion of this type of horn see Karlgren, number 17 (50.46.18ab). Patina green and blue-green.",
