  "text": "This large, ornate vase is shaped in vague imitation of an ancient bronze wine vessel. Eight ears project from the neck and shoulder of the vase: the four at the neck carved in a bird form, those at the shoulder in an animal mask form with pendant loose rings. High relief borders define the main decor zone, which is carved with animal masks like those commonly found on ancient bronze vessels. Four vertical, notched bands are carved in high relief on the base, and the tall cover of the vase is adorned with a band of phoenix designs and a stylized lotus flower finial.",
