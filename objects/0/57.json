  "text": "The allegorical figure carrying abundant fruits stands for Wealth (Dovizia in Italian). It is derived from the famous sculpture by Donatello, which used to tower over the market square in Florence. Whereas the large-scale market figure advertised the agricultural products for sale, and at the same time celebrated the ideal of public prosperity through trade, this colourful small-scale version embodies the ideal of a happy family life. Della Robbia added an infant playing tag with its pet dog to the model in order to suggest domestic happiness. The inscription turns a verse from the Psalms of David into a blessing: GLORIA ET DOVITI[A]E IN DOMO TVA (\"Honour and Wealth [shall be] in Your Home\").",
