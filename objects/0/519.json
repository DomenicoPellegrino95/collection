Tapestries celebrating the hunt were intended to entertain rather than overwhelm. They served to make the room appear larger and remind the viewer of the pleasures of a favorite outdoor sport. This is one of a set of four owned by the museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAudio numbers:\r\nBlue 119\r\nBlack 531",
