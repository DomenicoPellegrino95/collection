  "text": "The sport of hunting, which was enjoyed by European aristocracy, was a particularly popular theme for tapestries woven both in Flanders and France. Tapestries were most often woven in sets. These sets were made up of a number of wall hangings that have the same borders surrounding distinct images with related themes. The size of a set of tapestries can be as small as four pieces, one for each wall of a room, or as large as twelve hangings, which would have been placed between doorways and windows in a grand hall. Themes ranged from specific historical or biblical events to something as general as the seasons or the months of the year.",
