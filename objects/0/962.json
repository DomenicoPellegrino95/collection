  "text": "A combination of four masks occurs on this bronze finial. A forceful <I>taotie<I> mask with recumbent C-shaped horns appears on one side of the top. This monster bites on a human head with the broad nose typical of early masks. On the other side, a ram's head with horns turned down, bites on a head resembling a <I>taotie<I>. This remarkable and unusual work is a powerful example of early Chinese sculpture.",
  "description": "An eccentric combination of four masks occurs on this bronze. A forceful t\\'ao-t\\'ieh head with recumbent C-shaped horns, the borders decorated with straight and T-shaped scores, appears on one side of the top. This monster bites on a human head with the broad nose typical of many early masks. On the other side a ram\\'s head, with horns turned down, bites on a head resembling a t\\'ao-t\\'ieh but with a raised elephant\\'s trunk instead of the usual ridge in the central line. This remarkable and unusual piece is a powerful example of early Chinese sculpture. Patina green.",
