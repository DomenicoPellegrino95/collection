Thick, translucent bluish-green glaze on a body of greyish-white clay which shows through at edges where glaze is thin. The unglazed rim of the foot is a rusty brown, indicating the presence of iron in the clay",

  "text": "The Song dynasty (960-1279) was a period of relative peace which allowed a refined and introspective atmosphere to permeate court taste. This is reflected in the tranquil shapes and muted glazes of such classic Song wares as northern celadon, Ding and Guan wares. Of those Song ceramics given court patronage, however, few are as admirable as the finest Long Quan celadons, typified by their simple, well-proportioned forms and their thick, lustrous, blue-green glaze that approximates polished jades in its brilliance. This porcelain bowl represents in its quiet purity, the quintessence of twelfth-century court taste. The double fish motif seen here is a traditional Chinese symbol of marital happiness.",
