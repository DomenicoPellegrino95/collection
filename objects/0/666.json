  "text": "The Sung dynasty (960-1279) was a period of relative peace which allowed a refined and introspective atmosphere to permeate court taste. This is reflected in the tranquil shapes and muted glazes of such classic Sung wares as northern celadon, Ting and Kuan wares. Of those Sung ceramics given court patronage, however, few are as admirable as the finest Lung-ch'uan celadons, typified by their simple, well-proportioned forms and their thick, lustrous, blue-green glaze that approximates polished jades in its brilliance. This porcelain bowl represents in its quiet purity, the quintessence of twelfth-century court taste. The double fish motif seen here is a traditional Chinese symbol of marital happiness.",
  "description": "Bowl, shallow, with rim, of celadon ware from the Lung-Ch\\'uan district. The bottom is decorated with two fish in relief under the glaze, and the outside of the body is carved in a design of leaves. Thick, translucent bluish-green glaze on a body of greyish-white clay which shows through at edges where glaze is thin. The unglazed rim of the foot is a rusty brown, indicating the presence of iron in the clay",
