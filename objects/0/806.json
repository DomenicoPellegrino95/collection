  "text": "These painted figures represent a bearded civil dignitary clad in official court dress and a military officer wearing riding boots and protective clothing. The faces are highly individualized, indicating through their large mouths, eyes and beard, that they are of Khotanese, rather than Chinese origin. Painted figures such as these are the predecessors to the impressive glazed tomb figurines that later distinguished T'ang ceramics.",
