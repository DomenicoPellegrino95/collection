  "text": "Made of exquisitely crafted gold, these five boxes bearing emblems of the Eight Taoist Immortals are from an original set of eight which was presented to the Ch'ien-lung emperor in 1779, perhaps on the occasion of his birthday. Superbly worked in cast, chased and filigree techniques, these objects stand as a testament to the technical virtuosity so often encountered in Ch'ien-lung period (1736-1797) decorative arts. The whereabouts of the three missing boxes is unknown.",
