  "description": "Hanging of embroidered imperial yellow satin with an upper valance of brocaded red satin. The central design of the lower portion shows the Yin and Yang symbol emerging from a lotus flower. In the field on either side are large lotus blossoms and trailing branches. The colors include shades of blue, green, coral, mulberry, pink, yellow and tan. Chiefly satin stitch and couching. The brocaded valance carries a row of hanging lanterns with mystic symbol pendants in shades of brown and tan. Around the edge, and separating valance from main field is a band of black satin embroidered with running floral pattern in shades of blue. Lining of yellow cotton. NoteA.P. thinks brocade may be later than early 18th century.",
