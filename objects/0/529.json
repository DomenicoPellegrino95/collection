  "text": "The story of Lucretia is written in her solemn and saddened gaze, in the traces of blood on her gown and the dagger in her hand. The wife of a Roman nobleman, she was known for her virtue and loyalty. Then she was raped by Sextus Tarquinius, the son of the ruling tyrant. The next day, Lucretia revealed the crime to her husband and father, and, in their presence, took her own life. She chose death over dishonor.\r\n\r\nRembrandt painted this story in two of his most moving paintings. The first version, painted in 1664 and now in the collection of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., depicts Lucretia just before she takes her life. This second version, painted in 1666, portrays Lucretia moments after she has plunged the knife into her heart.\r\n\r\n",
