  "description": "Dutch landscape. Golden Age of Holland. A wide river with various river craft, which stretches across the width of the canvas and flows to meet the horizon. In the far right distance, a village can be seen through a gentle mist, while on the wooded bank to the left, a cart filled with singing and shouting peasants stands before a row of cottages. As they wave to the boatload of passengers approaching the shore, a ferryboat loaded with cattle pushes off. Further upstream, a boat in full sail carries its passengers toward the distant hamlet with its church steeple.",

  "text": "Nothing could be more Dutch than boats on a wide river under a cloudy sky. Water was the most important element in Holland's economy, since rivers and canals formed its main commercial arteries. From fields and towns to foreign ports, water transport strongly contributed to the country's prosperity. Here, a ferry jammed with cows draws toward shore. On land, a stately group in a carriage may be waiting for the ferry to empty. A rowboat carrying several jolly couples floats nearby. A sailboat points deeply into space. The diagonal lines of the riverbank and the sweeping clouds help convey the sailboat's direction toward the horizon and its possible destination. These motifs were all carefully chosen. For the Dutch, each of these details proved comfortably familiar and culturally meaningful. Serene rivers and boats underscore the peacefulness and affluence of this newly independent country.",
