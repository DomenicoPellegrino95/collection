  "text": "It is rare to find the human face used as a motif in early Chinese bronzes. This small fitting also exhibits four simplified <I>t'ao-t'ieh<I> masks in rounded relief at the end of each tube. The object most likely served to connect the leather straps of a horse bridle. The internment of horses in royal and aristocratic bronze age tombs was relatively common in ancient China and a great number of bronze chariot and harness fittings have been retrieved from such burials.",
