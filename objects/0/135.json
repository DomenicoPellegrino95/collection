  "text": "Dupré skillfully captured the many moods and great force of nature. The sky is as oppressive and threatening as it is light and sunny, and the imposing mass of oak trees confers a dark majesty on the landscape. Yet for all the forboding,the sun has managed to penetrate the clouds, the field is dancing with wind and sunlight, and the cattle are peacefully enjoying the day.\r\nDupré was a largely self-taught member of the Barbizon School, artists who painted pure landscapes as opposed to still lifes, historic events, or other academic subjects. They especially enjoyed painting the right terrain and varied landscape within the Forest of Fontainebleau, a wild area near the village of Barbizon in northern France.",
