  "text": "Baskets became important to the O'odham (Papago/Pima) economy with the introduction of the railway and tourist market in the 1880s.  New forms and designs emerged to accommodate Euro-American taste.  Basket makers experimented with representational designs including, human figures, dogs and butterflies.  Market demand for smaller, more portable items created a new style: the miniature basket. Incredibly difficult to produce, they showcase the weavers' skill.",
