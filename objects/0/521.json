  "text": "Hunting as a sport has been enjoyed for centuries. Many European noblemen were particularly fond of this activity, from the excitement of the chase to the satisfaction of a successful adventure. Here we see the hunters and their dogs enjoying the warmth of a fire at the end of the day. Notice the wine flask cooling in the pond in the lower left corner of the tapestry as well as the man in the center of the image, carrying the roast leg from part of the day's catch. <P>\r\nThis tapestry, one of a set of four owned by the museum, celebrates the activities associated with hunting which was an activity much enjoyed by the aristocracy.",
