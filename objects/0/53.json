  "text": "Courbet was an avowed realist. Even at the height of the fanciful Romantic era, he painted only what he saw—mostly nudes, portraits, and landscapes—with the objective eye of a camera. He was an enthusiastic sportsman, and in the late 1850s he began to specialize in forest and hunting scenes. This picture shows the forthright style of his late career, when his stubborn independence inspired the Impressionists and other artists working against the grain.\r\nThis painting once belonged to James J. Hill (1838–1916), the Minnesota railroad magnate whose collection of European paintings forms the basis of the MIA's 19th-century art collection.",
