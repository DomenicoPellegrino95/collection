  "text": "Urpu vessels like this were used to store small amounts of chicha, a corn-based beer, for an Inka household. The form of an urpu is ideal for storage and transportation: straps would be wrapped around the long neck and secured by little hooks at the base of the  neck. The bottom is pointed for pouring. By placing the point in a divot of earth or sand, the jar can move easily, avoiding unintentional spills.",
