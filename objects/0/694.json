  "text": "Moche artists created portrait vessels that captured the likeness of high-ranking members of society. This powerful figure sports a sumptuous headdress, ear spools, tunic, and bracelets. He is an example of how high ranking Moche men would have dressed, and demonstrates how appearance communicated power. His elevated status is reinforced in his imposing stance, broad shoulders, and fixed gaze. Tombs for wealthy and powerful Moche elites often contained large quantities of ceramic vessels, metalwork, and other luxury goods, securing their prestige into the afterlife. ",
