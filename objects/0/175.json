  "text": "The Little house was one of Frank Lloyd Wright’s last great Prairie School residences. Long and low, its design was based on two large rectangles joined together, but Wright made things more interesting by integrating the home into the natural rolling landscape—he always preferred to build into a hill rather than on top of it. The home’s hallway, shown in this gallery, faced Lake Minnetonka (it is on the side of the model facing the hallway). ",
