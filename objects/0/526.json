  "text": "This handsome wheel-thrown vessel with its raised bosses, taut symmetrical profile and thin walls, suggests a metalware prototype. A Shang innovation was the development of a high-fired clay body that is dense, hard, and impervious to liquid. Near stoneware hardness, these vessels were fired at a relatively high temperature around 1200 degrees C. High-fired ware was a considerable improvement over low-fired earthenware which was porous and permeable and less suitable for prolonged storage.",
  "description": "Jar, round, with decoration of incised geometrical designs in three bands around shoulder and body. Three projecting rings for handles- two on shoulder and one midway between on lower part of body; polished surface, no glaze. Grey earthenware.",
