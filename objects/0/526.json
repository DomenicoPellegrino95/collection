  "text": "This handsome wheel-thrown vessel with its raised bosses, taut symmetrical profile and thin walls, suggests a metalware prototype. A Shang innovation was the development of a high-fired clay body that is dense, hard, and impervious to liquid. Near stoneware hardness, these vessels were fired at a relatively high temperature around 1200 degrees C. High-fired ware was a considerable improvement over low-fired earthenware which was porous and permeable and less suitable for prolonged storage.",
