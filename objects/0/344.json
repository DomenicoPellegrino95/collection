The bear\\'s head is characterized by large mouth set with teeth, large round nose with sudden turn to forehead. On the side sof the dish are two pairs of flippers, or perhaps one pair of flippers and the whale\\'s dorsal fin. The teeth are semi-cylindrical rods of bone, the joints of the flippers and the top of the dish rim are inset with ovals of bone, small white glass beads are set in the ends of the flippers, on the tail and around the dish rim. Eyes and nostrils inlaid with mother-of-pearl.",
