  "text": "King Charles I of England commissioned Rubens to paint a ceiling mural for the Banqueting House at Whitehall Palace in London. This is an oil sketch for the portion of the mural celebrating the power of the Stuart monarchy and the reign of James I, Charles' deceased father. <P>In this painting the child represents young Prince Charles, the embodiment of the union of England and Scotland. Three women crown him: the woman in red personifies England; the woman in yellow represents Scotland; and the third is Minerva, goddess of wisdom and war. Above them two cherubs hold the coat-of-arms of the United Kingdom.",
  "description": "Historical. Charles I, King of England. A helmeted Britannia, wearing violet drapery, holds steady the golden crown which England and Scotland, in red and yellow draperies, suspend above the head of the Infant Charles I. Two putti above support an escutcheon with the arms of the United Kingdom lightly indicated, and a putto below holds a torch to a heap of armor, spears, and dull red banners which the union makes no longer necessary.",
