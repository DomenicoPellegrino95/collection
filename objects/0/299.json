The veil here contains more than 9,000 tiny mirrors, designed to deflect the harmful intent of \"the evil eye.\"  A wealthy Muslim woman would have worn this kind of veil and tunic only on special occasions, completing the ensemble with a pair of loosely fitting silk trousers (<I>ejar<I>) with embroidered cuffs.",
