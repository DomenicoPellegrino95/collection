  "text": "Nasca pottery is characterized by a mastery of multi-colored pre-fire slip painting. The seabird represented is the Inca tern (Larosterna inca), distinguishable by the distinctive curved plumaged sprouting from the beak. It carries a small fish in its mouth, most likely an anchovy. Chili peppers, painted in alternating green and red along the bottom of the pot, were one of the earliest domesticated crops in the Andes.",
