The rim of the cover is decorated with a narrow band of thin, elongated triangles. the decor for the bowl displays a band of two rows of leaf-shaped motifs, those in the upper row springing from the function of those in the lower row. These motifs have narrow bands of striated lines forming a double-spiral motif in the center of the leaf. Above this decor band is a narrow belt of incised lozenges. Patina greyed-green with patches of sharper green and red.",
