  "text": "Probably made by foreign craftsmen working in England, this chest is an example of crosscultural design influence. The woods used for the decoration are all native to England, but the complex patterning of buildings in fantasy perspective originated in the German city of Cologne late in the 16th century. At that time, craftsmen from around Cologne settled in Southwark, across the Thames River from London, to avoid the restrictions placed on foreigners by the city guilds.\r\n\r\nThese craftsmen specialized in marquetry--designs made of different woods cut from thin sheets (veneers) and then fitted together and glued to furniture as decoration. Organizing this work in a way previously unknown in England, they made veneered panels in standard sizes and produced ornamental strips by the foot, to be used as needed. The discontinuity of pattern in the corners of the bands that frame the buildings suggest that such prefabricated ornament was used on this chest.",
