  "text": "Born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, Douglas Volk began his early art training in Italy and then in Paris, where he studied under Jean-Léon Gérôme. In 1886, Volk became the first director of the Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts, from which the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and the Minneapolis College of Art and Design developed. He served as the director until 1893.\r\n\r\nWhile in Minnesota, Volk and his wife became friends with Mr. and Mrs. H.E. Thompson. The artist often painted their daughters, Caroline and Abbie. After the Reception portrays a young Caroline as a weary bride in full regalia. In one sitting for this painting, Volk adjusted the neck of the gown so more of Caroline’s shoulder was showing. The young sitter blushed and Mrs. Volk, who always sat in on these sessions, responded, “Now, my dear, Mr. Volk is an artist and he only thinks of you as he would a vase of flowers.”",
