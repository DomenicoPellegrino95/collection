  "text": "The task of heating water for brewing tea was considered anything but mundane in the early 18th century, as illustrated by the elaborate design of this kettle.  From the proudly arched \"swan-neck\" spout to the swelled form of the body, every element is as decorative as it is functional.  The lathe-turned wooden handles and lid's finial protect the user's hand from heat; the feet protect the tabletop.  Ornately scrolled feet of the spirit lamp stand elevate this kettle to a vessel as stylish as tea drinking itself.",
