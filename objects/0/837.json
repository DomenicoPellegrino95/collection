The decor of the principal surface is confined to the upper belt, where rudimentary t\\'ao-t\\'ieh masks are flanked by head-turning dragons in flat relief on a ground of squared spirals. The heavy, segmented flanges at the corners of the vessel reappear as the central ridges of the forceful t\\'ao-t\\'ieh heads on the legs. Patina gray-green",
