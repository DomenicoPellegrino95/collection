The body decor is in three belts, the two lower ones interupted by flanges corresponding to the supporting birds. The middle belt, of realistic cicades in rounded relief on spiral ground, is bordered by narrower bands with big eyes connected by diagonal lines, C-figures, and fork-like elements which may represent strongly disfigured dragons. Patina grey-green patches of brighter green",
