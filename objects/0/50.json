  "text": "This painting depicts three separate Biblical episodes. To the left, Joseph is seen by a spring which miraculously appeared to quench the thirst of the Holy Family during their flight from Herod's massacre of male children, a scene represented in the distant village to the right.  During their flight, Mary asked a peasant to tell Herod's army that they had passed by while he was sowing grain. Overnight, his wheat grew, seen to the right, so that the soldiers gave up their pursuit, assuming the travellers to have gone by months before.",
