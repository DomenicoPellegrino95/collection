  "text": "The theme of the hunt, one of the earliest to be represented in art, has been a perennial favorite in all media. The tapestries celebrating the hunt were intended to entertain rather than overwhelm. They served to make the room appear larger and remind the viewer of the pleasures of a favorite outdoor sport. This is one of a set of four owned by the museum.<P>\r\nIt is possible that this tapestry was once used as a door cover as at one time it was slit up the middle. To repair damaged areas and strengthen weak sections, this tapestry underwent treatment in the museum's textile conservation area between September 1988 and July 1991.",
