  "description": "The purpose served by this object is altogether unknown. A rectangular handle projects from the domed base, and the openwork on the body suggests that the bird may have been a rattle or a bell. The whorl circle on the base, the crest and horns, and the flange of T-shaped scores along the back, indicate an early period. Patina green.",
