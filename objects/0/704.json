Included here are an ice cream pail, which chilled creams and sorbets, a pair of cream cups, a tray with preserve or jam pots, dinner plates, and dessert plates.  Several skilled artisans decorated the objects, including Antoine-Joseph-Chappuis, Etienne Evans, and Francois-Joseph Aloncle.  \r\n\r\nThe service was in the collections of Prince Demidoff Leopold and Anthony de Rothschild throughout its rich history of ownership.  Today other pieces of the service are in museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Toledo Museum of Art, and the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City.",
