  "text": "Although assuming the general shape of a small <I>yung-cheng<I> bell, this instrument lacks the ring suspension device of the <I>yung-cheng<I> as well as the thirty-six bosses found on most late Chou bells. Furthermore, the <I>t'ao-t'ieh<I> mask on the body would be upside-down, if suspended. During Shang and Western Chou, however, bells of similar shape were held in an upright position and struck. If this bell were played rim upward, the mask would be right-side-up. This type of bell was probably not used in graduated sets. The incised bird, volute, triangular and running-spiral patterns are similar to those found in painted lacquers of the same era.",
  "description": "This bell, in cross section a pointed oval with an arched line at the bottom has a bottle-shaped handle that is most unusual. The decor field, confined to the body of the bell, is filled with granulation. It displays a variation of the \\'volute with angle\\' theme; every two such figures combine into larger compounds, the whole resulting in a lozenge pattern. The border is partly a running spiral pattern and partly dissolved dragon figures. At the lower corners are sinuously drawn birds with S- or heart shaped horns. The mask of a playful t\\'ao-t\\'ieh must be seen from above. Patina brownish green with brighter green patches.",
