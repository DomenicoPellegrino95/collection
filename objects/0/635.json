  "text": "Se-‘e-he Ki, or Elder Brother’s House is the name of these basket designs.  Se-‘e-he was the hero in many old stories of the Akimel O’othom.  At first he was held in great esteem, but later he lost his popularity and became a vagabond, often being pursued by his enemies after voyaging into the village from his home in the mountains.  He would retreat, but the trails were so confusing that his enemies could never follow him.  Carefully tracing the basket’s maze design will lead to his home in the center without crossing any lines.",
  "description": "Miniature flat plaque; coiled. Design consists of a central devil\\'s claw from which emanates a maze pattern, at the entrance of which stands a human figure.  This pattern is called the House of Shuihii Ki, a legendary figure, who supposedly lives in the mountains where no one can find him.  Colors are natural and black.",
