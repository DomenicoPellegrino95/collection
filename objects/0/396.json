  "description": "Buddha, bronze seated figure in attitude of contemplation, also known as the Mudra, or position of 'calling the earth to witness'. The green bronze pedestal is in two tiers; the upper one shows lotus leaves in relief beneath a beaded rim, and the lower, (broken at right side) with ovoid indentations, some of them perforated. The ears are weighted but unadorned. The hair is short, in spiky curls and the usnisa had indentation to hold flame, which is missing. The eyes are enameled, proving the figure to be a late piece.",

  "text": "This sculpture shows the moment at which the Buddha achieved enlightenment under a tree, seen through his right hand touching the earth.  Before he was the Buddha, he was known as the prince Siddhartha, who rejected the luxuries of palace life and became a mendicant, traveling the countryside delivering sermons and never remaining anywhere more than a single night. Through personal renunciation, the Buddha embodied his highest aim, living a life of non-attachment.",
