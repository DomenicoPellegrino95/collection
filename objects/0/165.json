The incised decor is accented in turn with three spots of dark aubergine, yellow, and green glazes on a ground of cream-white slip. The use of yellow or amber in combination with green on a cream ground is a T'ang dynasty (618-906) innovation called san-t'sai (three color) that continued in popularity through the Ch'in (1115-1234) and Liao dynasties in North China.",
