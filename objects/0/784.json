He watches as the widowed Greek queen, Artemisia, in the central boat, directs the capture of the city. The principle that a queen as well as a king could not only protect a kingdom but also initiate military actions was a concept that was useful to reinforce the personal power of several regent queens of France during the 16th and 17th centuries.<P>\r\r\nThe reference to important historic personages or events incorporated into tapestry images frequently gives power by association to the people who own these large, impressive hangings.<P>\r\nFrom the Stories of Queen Artemisia series.\r\n\r\nAudio numbers:\r\nBlue 439",
