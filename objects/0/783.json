  "text": "This tapestry uses the story of the classical Queen Artemisia of Caria to allude to the skill and readiness of the armies of the French king Henry IV (1589-1610). Despite the actual location of Caria in Asia Minor, in this tapestry Artemisia's troops use a ruined fortress appropriate to 17th century France as a staging ground for their performance of a \"mimic war.\" Mounted archers and swordsmen practice techniques while infantrymen storm the fortress by bridge and moat. The troop's vigorous poses and rearing horses suggest an energetic battle. However the incongruent stances taken by the combatants suggest that they are not practicing tactics against each other, but against imaginary opponents.",
