  "text": "This \"table-top\" ceramic sculpture of a seated dignitary depicts the court official Kuan Chung, also called Kuan Ti and Kuan Yu. Kuan is the general whose legendary exploits during the Three Kingdoms period (221-265) restored political order following the collapse of Han in 221. He was eventually deified as the patron deity of literature, but is most commonly worshiped as the god of war protector against all forms of evil and strife.\r\n<P>The relatively large size and unusual palette of green, blue, and aubergine enamels distinguish this Tz'u-chou ceramic. It is a fine example of early, overglaze enamel decoration.",
