  "description": "Khilim rug woven by Karamanians- nomads of Turkoman descent.  Dark blue ground with bold octagon designs in red, brown and green.  This Khilim has been woven in two pieces so irregularly that when placed together the octagons, woven half upon each piece, do not coincide.  There is a long fringe at one end and a short one at the other.",
