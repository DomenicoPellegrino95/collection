  "text": "During the Qianlong reign, a large number of the most realistic and keenly observed botanic and animal forms of jade were created. This was partially encouraged by an increase in supply of refined materials.The abundant supply of good material permitted judicious selection for colors, tone, and texture. Craftsmen of mid-Qing cleverly exploited the natural colors of the material. In particular they exploited and ingeniously utilized the variety of color existing in one piece of stone. Here, the craftsman has converted the white half into three finger citrons or “Buddha’s hands”: two smaller fruits are attached to a primary one. Another part of the stone, the red half, was carved into gnarled stalks and leaves, containing three pomegranates, three peaches and a blossom. In addition, exquisite openwork is skilfully combined with striking colors and uses red and white jadeite to great effect, cleverly integrating the white mottling and flaws on the primary red part into the design of the pomegranate’s exposing seeds. Seemingly, a red mottling on the white component was turned into a bat.",
