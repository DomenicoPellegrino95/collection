  "description": "Rug, Shirvan (?). There are three large medallions through the center of a red field. The surrounding space is filled with octagons  and various geometrical dersigns. There are two borders; the very wide outer one carries the Georgian border in white, the inner narrow one a rosette stripe. The background of this rug is distinctly shaded, a Kurdish trick sometimes found in other Nomad rugs. Sides are selvedged in dark wool. Ends have a narrow web with warp threads. Ghiordes knot. Woolen warp, woolen weft.",
