  "description": "Towel scarf of loosely woven linen embroidered with colored silks. The pattern consists of blossoms springing from foliations of various shapes symmetrically arranged, and detached floral sprays; it covers the whole of the ground with the exception of a narrow pillar-shaped space in the middle. Similar to 30.23.65 though the workmanship is not as good. Dark red and blue are the dominating colors. Two narrow borders of drawn work, and fringe at each end.",
