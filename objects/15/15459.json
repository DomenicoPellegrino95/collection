(\\'checkerboard\\') contains a badly designed hexagonal medallion, which in turn contains ten octagon shapes in various colors.  The hearth field is enclosed by a reciprocal sawtooth band in three shades.  Three borders, the main one made up of geometric single flowers divided by three triangles laid end to end.  Ends-narrow web with loose warp threads.  Sides-over cast with different colored yarns.  Ghiordes knot.",
