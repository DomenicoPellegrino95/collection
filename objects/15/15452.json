  "description": "shawl, embroidered, of the Kusaba or square type. the field is black, of the so-called twill weave, and the principal designs, cut from variously colored shawl cloths, are either inserted or applied, and are joined to the main body of the shawl by such skillful embroidery that it is almost impossible to detect. A brilliant border surrounds the entire square. Red, white and turquoise blue are the predominating colors, combined with shades of yellow, green, and rose. The design is the well known Kashmir butha or flower motif with variations. Wool.",
