  "text": "Through the popularity of the Daoist idea of sacred mountains as the realm of immortals, images of these immortal realms developed into fantastic worlds of mountains and valleys, sometimes dotted with beautiful palaces where immortals happily lived. In this joyous world the immortals are well-dressed like high governmental officials, and the jade maidens or female attendants look like lades of the court; they live in pavilions and halls like those in the imperial palace. This beautiful turquoise sculpture represents such an idea, and is a simpler version of the much more complicated image of the immortalâ€™s realm.",
