  "description": "Crimson satin panel, brocaded in self-toned ogival motifs framing a large leaf design surrounded by a flower garland. The large leaves and ogival framings are embroidered in gold thread. Lined with cerise silk. The panel is composed of 15 squares of satin sewn together, 3 horizontally, 5 vertically. The second and third rows from the top are pieced together by an inch-wide band extending across the panel. The gold embroidery here and immediately above is much later than the rest. The pane has been skillfully darned and pieced in a number of places.",
