  "text": "Morocco's cultural traditions, although deeply rooted in Berber and Islamic customs, have also been enriched over the centuries by European culture. In the fifteenth century Azemmour became an important trading port as well as a transitory residence for southern European merchants, whose influence directly contributed to the distinct style of Azemmour embroidery. The imagery found in nearly every Azemmour textile features a central tree or fountain motif placed between two birds, a type of ornamentation found in Italian and Spanish needlework and mosaics.\r\n\r\nThis type of panel would have functioned as covering for the sides of mattresses, and as hangings and trimmings for curtains and cushions.",
