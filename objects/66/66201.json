  "text": "The classic 1953 \"Osterizer\" was designed by Don Carlson and Al Madl. It shares with and earlier MÃ¼ller-Munk designed model a heavy chromed base but the stepping is rounded rather than hard-edged, topped with a rather chunky glass top. Although designed for the domestic market, it has the look and feel of professional, high-tech catering equipment. The blender makes an interesting appearance in the 1991 remake of the movie, \"Father of the Bride.\"",
