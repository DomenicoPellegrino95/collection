  "text": "White Clover was Wright's first experiment with pattern on dinnerware. The clover motifs were scratched through the glaze to the ceramic body, unlike most dinnerware patterns of the time which were transfer printed.  General Electric distributed the clock Wright created to accompany the line in matching colors.  Unfortunately, White Clover had no national distributor, and despite the efforts of Wright and Harker Pottery to market the line, sales were not good and it was discontinued within five years of its introduction.  It did not help matters that American Modern and Casual China were still selling well and for less--Wright's biggest competitor for White Clover appeared to be himself.",
