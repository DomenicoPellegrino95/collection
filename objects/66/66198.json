  "text": "The \"Toast-O-Lator\" was a new, innovative solution to toasting both sides of the bread simultaneously, the only home toaster that moves bread slices while being toasted by means of a built-in, conveyer-belt assembly line. Completely automatic, a slice is inserted at one end and continues past the \"Wind-O-Spy\" porthole permitting one to monitor the toast's progress end to end. The left base is purposely rounded so the toast will drop down and out on a plate.",
