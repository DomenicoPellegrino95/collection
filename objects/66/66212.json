  "text": "Saluta was not the first manufacturer to introduce the novelty of toasting four slices of bread simultaneously (the Estate Stove Company introduced the idea in 1922), but the concept took a firm hold with Saluta. Four rotating wire toast-holders surround a central, cylindrical heating element. Pulling the knob on any one swings all four in either direction, thereby reversing the slices simultaneously. Saluta toasters went through a series of modifications, this being one of its later models.",
