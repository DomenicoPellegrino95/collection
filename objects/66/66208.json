  "text": "By the 1920s, Manning-Bowman had perfected the chromium-plating process which enabled it to produce Art Deco inspired coffee and cocktail sets such as this stunning coffee urn from its Giftware line. It was intended for entertainment, aimed at the wealthy who could afford its rather stiff price (particularly for chrome, not silver). The company also introduced the steep method of brewing coffee and for many years, was the leading percolator manufacturer in the U.S. Notable for its spherical form, everything about it is circular, from the incised ribbing, the step-back elements of the base, the arc of the handle, to the distinctive catalin disk lever on the spout.",
