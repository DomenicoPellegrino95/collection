  "text": "Wright's Casual China line for Iroquois China Company was not as adventurous design-wise as American Modern, but it possessed some of the same qualities such as organic forms and mix-and-match colors such as Sugar White, Ice Blue, Ripe Apricot, and Pink Sherbet.  The pieces were made of harder-bodied stoneware fired at 2,300 degrees F, so Iroquois confidently guaranteed replacement upon breakage for three years.  To market the superior qualities of their design, Russel and Mary Wright did in-store demonstrations of its durability, dumping a load of just-washed dishes out onto a counter. \r\n\r\nOne of the innovations of Casual China was the space-saving stackability of several of the early pieces such as the creamer/sugar and the salt/pepper, both shown.  It also included artistic touches such as the palette-shaped hostess plate seen here.  Never satisfied, however, Wright tinkered with the design several times; pieces shown here from a major 1957 restyling include the creamer in Cantaloupe, the gravy with stand cover in Nutmeg Brown, and the covered sugar and casserole, both in Lemon Yellow.  These updates bought Casual China some extra staying power until the line was finally discontinued in 1966.\r\n",
