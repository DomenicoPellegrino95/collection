  "text": "As with eggbeaters, engineering plays a pivotal role in those ice cream scoops with moving parts. This Italian scoop is thoughtfully conceived to provide the most efficient means of scooping up frozen ice cream, and then, more importantly, subsequently dislodging the scoop by means of a gear-lever which rotates a scraper bar element inside the cup when activated.  Today, the Effepi firm specializes in kitchen sink faucets, among the most advanced in appearance and function.",
