  "text": "The designer of the bottle warmer remains unknown, but the mechanism was likely invented by Sunbeam's chief engineer, Ivar Jepson. During the 1920s and 30s, many mechanical engineers evolved into talented industrial designers. Sunbeam also commissioned outside designers such as George Scharfenberg and Alphonso Iannelli. The bottle warmer's pronounced rocketship form exemplified America's effort to tame vertical space just as the 1930s skyscraper signified the static conquest of the air.",
