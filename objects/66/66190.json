  "text": "Whether the potato baker is a great invention or simply a good intention is questionable. But, as streamline form, it is undeniably \"so yesterday.\" By releasing the spring-snap lock and separating the baking shell, a potato could be inserted onto a central spit or rod. The baker was then placed over a gas flame or electric burner for approximately an hour. It eliminated \"heating up a stove for one lone potato.\" The effect is \"a new taste thrill, a delicious new potato flavor and texture, soft and flaky, resulting from baking the potato in its own moisture.\"",
