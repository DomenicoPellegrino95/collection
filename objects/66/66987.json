  "text": "Johannes Winterberger was not the first publisher in Vienna, but he was the first whose name is known. About 1499, he published the Missale Defunctorum, which served as a script for requiem masses. The crucifixion scene served as the most important illustration in the book. Winterberger chose to print it on vellum and to color it with a more varied palette and more delicate touch than one finds, for instance, in the metal cut of Christ and the Samaritan Woman, seen nearby. The woodcut's material richness rivals that of a manuscript illumination, and the quality of drawing is higher than that found in all but the best manuscripts.",
