  "text": "Succeeding his father, Ichikawa Danjñrø V (1741-1806) became the head of the prominent Ichikawa lineage of actors in 1757. By the 1770s he was arguably the most celebrated actor of all time. His heyday coincided with the golden age of Kabuki in the city of Edo (today's Tokyo). He excelled in a wide variety of roles ranging from robust men to women, and print designers were never tired of depicting him.  Here he is shown portraying Wantetsu, a corrupt monk. His grimacing expression and wild hair convey the menacing nature of the character.",
