  "text": "One of Dansk's first designs, Kobenstyle is named for Copenhagen, the designer's favorite city.  The line is a lighter-weight, more contemporary version of a collection of cast-iron pots he created in 1950.  Many of the Kobenstyle pots have teak handles for a warm Scandinavian touch; the others are multipurpose oven-to-table ware.  Of Kobenstyle's distinctive colors, which have changed over the many years it has been in production, Quistgaard has said, \"Instead of black and brown, I wanted to add life and sparkle to the kitchen and dining room.\"  ",
