  "text": "In his landmark textbook published in 1940, Harold Van Doren inserted drawings to illustrate how geometric solids suggest modern products.  His tea kettle was placed beside a coffee urn designed by Eliel Saarinen to demonstrate the elastic variations of the hemisphere with the caption: \"How Solids Suggest Modern Products,\" while noting, \"casseroles, ice buckets, and kettles are generally cylinders, truncated cones, or hemispheres, as suggested by Fig. 46c.\" Interestingly, Harold Van Doren was an Assistant Director of The Minneapolis Institute of Arts for a brief period.\r\n",
