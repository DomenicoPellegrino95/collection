  "text": "Wood is the real star of Quistgaard's designs.  The son of a sculptor with a studio in the Danish woods, he was surrounded by the material as a boy.  As a designer, he says, \"wood became my favorite material at a very early stage.  I could not keep away from it; it fascinated me.\"  His teak ice buckets, with their staved construction, have become modern icons of Nordic design with its focus on wood, an abundant  natural material. They also showcase Quistgaard's sensitivities as a sculptor, as do his elegant trays and playful salt shaker/pepper mill combinations for Dansk.  Many of these wood pieces are roughed out by machine and finished by hand, preserving some of the arts-and-crafts qualities important to Quistgaard while taking advantage of modern technology to make good design available to all.\r\n\r\n",
