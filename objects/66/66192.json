  "text": "Extolling the benefits of coffee made by filtration rather than boiling (which, according to Peter Schlumbohm's instructional brochure, releases coffee fats that are \"disgusting even before turning rancid\"), the chemist-inventor offered a coffee maker that replicated the filtration process of the laboratory and mimicked its glass equipment as well. Assembled in his own factory from a Pyrex decanter supplied by the Corning Glass Works, this was the first of the line of \"products for the Chemist's Kitchen\" that he developed over the next two decades.",
