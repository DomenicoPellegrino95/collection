  "text": "Japanese potters, led by Hamada Shoji in the early 20th century, took renewed interest in the unassuming beauty of Japan’s folk ceramics. This large platter is typical of wares created in the small town of Onta in northern Kyushu. Local potters decorate the surface of their plates and platters by rhythmically dabbing the surface with a wide, slip-loaded brush as it rotates slowly on the wheel. This pattern is picturesquely referred to as <I>kasa-me<I>, or “umbrella look.” Splashes of green glaze further enliven the surface. This platter was once in Hamada’s collection.  ",
