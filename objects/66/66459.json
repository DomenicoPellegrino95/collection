  "text": "Jens Quistgaard was inspired by black-glazed Danish folk pottery when creating the Flamestone design.  This highly-acclaimed matt-glazed stoneware line (in \"deep lusty brown\" according to a Dansk brochure) appeared in 1957 in a plain form; Dansk introduced the fluted version, seen here, in 1962.  It was produced until the late 1970s.  The attenuation of the coffeepot and creamer is typical of modern design circa 1960; at this time, designers were providing new and creative variations for an American public comfortable with modernism.",
