  "text": "Around 1945, Ekco Housewares Co. decided to develop a line of high-quality kitchen tools with superior durability (appropriately titled, \"Best\"). Since there was no in-house company designer, the firm's tool-room foreman and product engineers were given the responsibility of designing the new product range. The resulting stainless steel and plastic \"Flint\" tool line, introduced in 1946, was significantly more expensive than competitor products, yet it sold very well.",
