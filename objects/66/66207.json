  "text": "Earl Tupper left DuPont as a chemist in 1938 to form his own plastics company. Four years later he developed a method of producing thin-walled polythene containers for which he devised an airtight resealable lid (based on those used for paint cans). When the line was first introduced in the late 1940s, <I>House Beautiful<I> magazine enthusiastically labeled them as \"fine art for 39 cents,\" an endless array of designs now recognized as classics in plastic. Tupper lost little time in parlaying that endorsement into an empire. An innovator on many levels, he then developed a program for selling direct to the housewife by means of hugely successful Tupperware home parties. The network grew so fast that by 1951 it became a global outfit called Tupperware Homes Plastics.  ",
