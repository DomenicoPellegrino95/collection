  "text": "Dover was the best-known name in eggbeaters, but the Maynard model was the epitome of advanced technology and engineering. It is a compendium of mechanical engineering, with a canted handle (ergonomic before its time), a rubberized covering over the gears (with pin holes for periodic oiling) and silent rotating gears. It is a miniature turbine, fully functional and symbolic emblem of the machine age. As marriages of convenience go, the designer-manufacturer union produced extraordinary offspring.",
