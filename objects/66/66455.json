  "text": "This rare bandolier bag is only one of three complete bags of its type known to exist. It was created using a loomless weaving technique known as finger weaving, which resembles braiding.  This technique allowed the artist to incorporate decorative elements such as beads right into the weave itself.  The beads were strung on an independent thread, which created zigzag lines and patterns when woven into the fabric.  What makes this object even more unusual is that finger weaving was usually used for garters and sashes, and only rarely for bandolier bags. The European residents of North America later adopted this ancient Native technique.\r\n",
