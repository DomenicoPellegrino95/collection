  "text": "Wright experimented with dinnerware designs in melamine plastic in the 1940s, but little public interest existed in this use of the material until the early 1950s, when his Residential line hit the market.  The unbreakable line appealed to post-war housewives who had embraced Wright's casual modern designs (and the step-by-step directions for the casual lifestyle he and Mary laid out in their <I>Guide to Easier Living<I>).  Residential  won Good Design awards from New York's Museum of Modern Art in 1953 and 1954.  In 1954, Wright introduced variations on Residential with the Home Decorators line.",
