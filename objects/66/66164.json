  "text": "Footrests were common accompanyments to formal chairs in upper-class Chinese households. While the rest served to elevate the feet from cold or damp masonry flooring, it also functioned as a symbol of a person's rank within society, as footrests were assigned to those chairs, couches, or beds used by the highest members of the family. This rest is unusual for its half-round shape.",
