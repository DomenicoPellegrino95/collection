In 1929 he came to the United States to work for various ceramic manufacturers, eventually becoming the art director of Hall China. The popularity of the electric refrigerator in the late 1930s resulted in the production of numerous types of cold storage designs for Westinghouse, General Electric, Sears, among others.  The containers were thick-walled and heavy, made for continued use.",
