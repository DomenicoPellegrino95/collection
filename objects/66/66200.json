  "text": "The Helmco Lacy Company developed a cold water brewing system still being used today.  The process consists of pouring 12 to 16 ounces of course ground coffee into the filtering channel, then adding cold water. Left to steep overnight the resulting liquid concentrate is enough to supply about 45 cups. As advertised, \"oils, acids and sediment familiar with old fashioned boiling, will not dissolve in cold water. They are discarded with the grounds leaving only the fine aromatic coffee flavor. Not a trace of bitterness or after taste.\"",
