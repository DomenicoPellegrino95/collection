  "text": "For years, coffee connoisseurs have pursued their preferred-and usually very precise-techniques for preparing their favorite brew. This is reflected in the rich assortment of coffee machines available, from percolators, drip pots, vacuum pots, cafetières to espresso makers. In Europe, the simple filter method of coffee-making had long been favored (particularly in Italy), and the \"espresso\" method-used exclusively in cafés and for mass catering-had become highly popular by the 1950s. Their sculptured machine introduced the coffee craze across Europe, Great Britain and eventually America after the war. The Swiss introduced some ingenious coffee and chocolate machines such as this futuristic machine of the mid-fifties.  Embodying elements of a rocketship and miniature boiler plant, it was a machine that perfectly suited the ritualistic, avant-garde nature of coffee-making.",
