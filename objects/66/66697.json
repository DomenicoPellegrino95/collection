  "text": "The success of Zeisel's Museum and Town and Country services led to further dinnerware commissions for her in the early 1950s, including Tomorrow's Classic and Century, both produced by Hall China.  Zeisel was credited with her signature on the bottom of each piece of Tomorrow's Classic and Century.  These dinnerware lines followed the beautiful sculptural curves she established with her two early services, and were decorated with pattern decals designed either by Zeisel, her students at the Pratt Institute, or Hall's studio designers.  These patterns made Zeisel's original designs more appealing to American consumers, apparently put off by the unadorned white shapes.  By contrast, the silver-glazed Tomorrow's Classic teapot, shown nearby, is an apparent rarity. ",
