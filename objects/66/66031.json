  "text": "Traveling Japanese Zen monks returned to their country bearing many prized objects from Sung dynasty China, like this <I>cha-ire<I> or tea caddy. Small, finely crafted containers originally created to store spices and medicines, <I>cha-ire<I> were used by the Japanese to hold powdered tea for use in their tea ceremonies. Jars with a distinctly round shape, such as this one, were called <I>bunrin<I> or \"apple-shaped\" caddies. A previous owner of this <I>cha-ire<I> assigned it the poetic name \"waterdrop,\" which he inscribed on the caddy's outer box. ",
