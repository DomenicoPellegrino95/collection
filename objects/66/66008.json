Even today, Pierre Bonnard's sprawling illustrations interpret Paul Verlaine's sensual poetry with unusual insight. Bonnard's model for these rosy-pink lithographs was his longtime lover Marthe de Méligny (born Maria Boursin), whose languorous poses are interwoven with blocks of text with unprecendented freedom and expressiveness.",
