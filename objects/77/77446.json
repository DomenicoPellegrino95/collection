  "text": "This remarkable group of twenty-six gilded plaques, most likely from Szechwan province, includes silhouetted figures of animals, deities, <I>pi<I> discs, and <I>huang<I> arcs with twin dragon heads. Cut from bronze sheets and gilded, several plaques feature silver-plated highlights and engraved details. While Chinese archaeologists have verified that such plaques served as tomb decoration in expensive burials during the Eastern Han dynasty (25-220), it is not certain how they were arranged or to what they were affixed, possibly a wall of the tomb chamber or the sides of a lacquered wooden coffin.\r\n<P>More certain is the religious, especially Taoist, mythology expressed by several of these objects. The twin towers, for instance, represent the gate of heaven, and the four-winged human figures are the immortal <I>yu-jen<I> (literally, \"feathered men.\") Each carries the sacred <I>ling-chih<I> fungus of immortality. An openwork plaque depicts the Queen Mother of the West (<I>Hsi-wang mu<I>) in seated posture with her winged tiger and dragon on either side. Two of the three disks are engraved with images of Hsi-wang mu and heaven's gate. The circular <I>pi<I> disk itself is an ancient Chinese symbol for heaven and the wide arc-shaped <I>huang<I> with their dragon head finials are rooted in Bronze Age mythology and most likely functioned here as protective emblems. There is also an engraved quatrefoil motif representing the four directions, a group of six crested birds, and a magnificent phoenix possibly connoting the noble rank of the tomb occupant. The large, square plaque depicts a giant phoenix bird standing against swirling clouds in front of a slender girl wearing long robes with wide sleeves.Four domed, oval cicada-shaped bosses cover spikes in the four corners. Engraved on the backs with large wings and circuloar eyes, these insects were ancient symbols connoting long life.\r\n<P> Thought to be the largest such group of Han dynasty plaques in the West, the set provides excellent visits into the cult of heaven, que",
