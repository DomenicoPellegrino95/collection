  "text": "Most fashion fabrics are developed to be used as vertical patterns but many of the new nylon knit, Ja-eL designs were intended to be used in either direction or primarily as horizontal visuals.  <I>Oriental Stripe<I> is one of several patterns that highlighted border areas on skirts, dresses and pantsuits.  As a fashion statement <I>Sundown<I> was used almost exclusively as a vertical graphic, but toward the end of the decade when it metamorphosed into an upholstery fabric it was consistently featured in a horizontal orientation.  (See case in the center of this gallery)\r\n\r\nThe Larsen archive contains three colorways of <I>Oriental Stripe<I> and five colorways of <I>Sundown<I>.\r\n",
