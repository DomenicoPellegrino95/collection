  "text": "Spiky, rope-like, animal-adorned—luxurious gold jewelry takes many forms among the Asante and Baule peoples, who belong to the larger Akan cultural group. In any shape or form, the jewelry broadcasts wealth, status, and authority. Asante kings and queens adorn themselves so thoroughly they need physical support from attendants, while Baule men aspire to add to the gold treasure handed down from their ancestors, elevating themselves to the rank of “big man.”",
