  "text": "The Sumida River flows through Tokyo and empties into Tokyo Bay. During the Edo period, it served as a convenient manner of transporting goods into the heart of the city. Consequently, the neighborhoods along the river's banks were home to artists and merchants, while the wealthy aristocrats and warriors lived on higher ground. The Sumida was also famous as the route to the Yoshiwara, the licensed prostitution quarter of the city. In summer, small boats that doubled as floating restaurants and brothels carried boisterous visitors to the Yoshiwara. Sho_tei, however, created a more quiet view of the Sumida, with the boat's cabin tightly shuttered against the cold and the nearby cherry tree covered with snow. A smaller version of this print also exists, but because it lacks Sho_tei's seal or signature and this print's refinement, it is presumed to be a recent reproduction.",
