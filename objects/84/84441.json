  "text": "The Chinese Taoist immortal Tekkai had the unusual ability to exhale his soul from his body, thus allowing it to freely travel great distances. Once when Tekkai's soul had been gone for several days, his young disciple assumed that the immortal had abandoned his mortal body, so he cremated it. When Tekkai's soul finally returned, it had no place to reside and had to settle for the dead body of a lame beggar. Hence, Tekkai (literally \"iron crutch\") wears the beggar's tattered clothes and uses his crutch. Here he is shown in the act of exhaling his soul. ",
