  "text": "Glass dominated 20th century architecture, and the need for privacy as well as light control was a challenge the Larsen team met by creating fabrics that balanced opacity and transparency. In addition to the \"natural\" fibers such as cotton, linen and wool, which the company used in many of its fabrics, the studio experimented with a wide variety of  \"new-age\" materials from saran and lurex to glow in the dark paint printed on the <I>Halo<I> blind.\r\n\r\nWin Anderson loved challenges. She particularly remembers <I>Olympia<I> as a favorite because it was an opportunity to experiment with a variety of fibers and weave structures. To enhance the subtle elegance of the design, Anderson combined goat hair, bleached linen, and mercerized cotton in a textile containing double cloth, plain, basket, and other weaves. Her achievement with this fabric embodied the technical mastery found in many Larsen textiles.\r\n",
