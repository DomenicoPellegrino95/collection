  "text": "<I>Bahia Blind</I> is a design that celebrates the beauty of thread. Many Larsen textiles produced in the 1950s and 1960s rely on the quality of the yarn to create dynamic designs. Fabrics such as <I>Bahia Blind, Doria</I> and <I>Haitian Primitive</I> reflect Jack’s feeling that “the tragic loss of the Industrial Revolution was not hand weaving, but handspun yarns.” In 2000, Jack reinterpreted the design concept in <I>Bahia Blind II</I>, a hand woven fabric made in Thailand.",
