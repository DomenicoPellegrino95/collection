  "text": "Nikko is a vast complex of buildings located deep in an ancient crytomeria forest north of Tokyo. In 1617 the Japanese constructed it as a memorial shrine to Tokugawa Ieyasu, the founder of Japan's Edo period. In this print, Hasui illustrates the sacred bridge that crosses the Daiya River. Originally erected in 1636, the bridge is said to have been built on the spot where the eighth-century priest Shodo crossed the river on the backs of two giant serpents. The bridge was destroyed in a flash flood in 1902, but was rebuild two years later in its original design.",
