  "text": "In his memoir Jack Larsen wrote about the colorful upholsteries the company created for Braniff Airlines in the early 1970s. 'With the objective of maximizing variations within each cabin, the soft worsted damask stripes modulate down the back and across the seat. Almost imperceptibly, the color also progresses from the front to the back of the cabin.'",
