  "text": "The <I>Genji monogatari<I> or <I>Tales of Genji,<I>  a story of an idealized prince, inspired Japanese artists almost from the time that the noblewoman Murasaki Shikibu wrote it in the early eleventh century. This print is from a book illustrating important scenes from each of the novel's fifty-four chapters. In this case, the scene occurs in the forty-sixth chapter, titled \"Shiigamoto\" or \"Beneath the Oak.\" By this point in the story, prince Genji and his brother, the eighth prince, have died and prince Kaoru--thought by many to be Genji's son--visits Ogimi, Genji's brother's wife. All mourn Genji and his brother's absence, and spend their time trying to comfort one another. Here, one of the noblewomen offers food to the men in Kaoru's retinue. In the clouds above is written the verse (from which the chapter is named) that Kaoru recites when he visits the eighth prince's memorial chapel:\r\n\r\n<P><I>Beneath the oak I meant to search for shade.<I>\r\n<I>Now it has gone, and all is vanity.<I>\r\n",
