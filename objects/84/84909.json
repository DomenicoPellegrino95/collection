  "text": "To maximize the effort that goes into the sampling process during design development, mills create warps with stripes of colored yards that are interlaced with bands of the same or other colored yard during the weaving process. That way, designers can see a variety of color possibilities in just one cloth. Designers then make final production choices with a clear understanding of what the final effect will be in the specific design being tested.<P>\r\nColor blankets, as these samples are called, are utilitarian objects, to be disposed of after they have served their purpose. The archive gives no date or design for this particular piece, which may be have been used as a color reference for future projects.",
