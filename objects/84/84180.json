  "text": "Ohara Sho_son was trained as a painter in the Shijo_ school mode, in which birds and animals were depicted in a closely observed manner within naturalistic settings. On the suggestion of the American art expert Earnest Fenollosa, Sho_son began to design woodblock prints to meet the great demand for such images among American and European collectors. Here, Sho_son created a dramatic composition by contrasting the snow and egret's plumage with the darkness of night.",
