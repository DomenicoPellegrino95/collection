  "text": "Kiyomizu, or temple of \"pure water,\" is an enormous Buddhist complex that overlooks the city of Kyoto. Originally constructed in the eighth century, it has been destroyed and rebuilt many times. The present temple dates to 1629 and is famous for the spectacular view of Kyoto from the porch of the main edifice, which is built on timber pilings over a steep slope.   In this print, Hasui depicted the temple from even higher up the mountain in order to show the great roof of the temple's main hall. The city of Kyoto, which fills the valley, is shrouded in snow.",
