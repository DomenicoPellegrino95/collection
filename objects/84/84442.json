  "text": "A <I>vajra<I> (thunderbolt) is a ritual implement used in Esoteric Buddhist ceremonies. Originally a weapon carried by Indian Vedic gods, it was adopted into Buddhism as a symbol of the indestructible truth of the Buddha's teaching. Typically, <I>vajra<I> have a central axis that terminates in two, three, four, or five prongs. The configuration of this <I>vajra<I> thus represents a pair of \"crossed\" three-pronged <I>vajras<I>. The prongs stand for the Three Mysteries of Buddhism (actions, words, thoughts), and in crossed form signify that the Three Mysteries apply equally to the four cardinal directions.   ",
