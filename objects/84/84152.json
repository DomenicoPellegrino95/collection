  "text": "Between November 1884, and March 1885, Kiyochika created a thirty-four full-scale prints featuring views of Musashi province. As is evident from the title of the series, he intended to produce one hundred views, but for some reason abandoned the idea after the thirty-fourth design. Nevertheless, the prints were immensely popular and many were later reprinted. This image was reproduced on a miniature scale for Christmas greeting cards. The image shows a lumberman trolling his way up the canal, his logs lashed together to form a makeshift boat.",
