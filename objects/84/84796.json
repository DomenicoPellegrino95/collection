  "text": "Many Larsen designs celebrate the natural geometric grid formed by warp and weft.  These seemingly simple lines and squares were often infused with intense colors for dramatic effect.<P>\r\nIn the 1960s, the Irish Export Board invited Jack Larsen to develop furnishing fabrics using local production resources.  After considerable experimentation with yarn and color development, weave density and finishing processes, Larsen created a number of new designs as part of the Irish Awakening collection.  Larsen continued this collaboration for three decades. <I>Round Tower</I> and <I>Check of Kells</I> were popular components of the Irish Awakening collection.  The designs of the two fabrics are based on polychrome blocks produced by warp and weft striping and enhanced by the combination of reverse twill and damask weave construction.  The undulating curves of <I>Round Tower</I> were achieved by utilizing a mill with jacquard equipment.",
