  "text": "With the rapid modernization of Japan in the later half of the 19th century, metal artists enjoyed considerable success at art expositions held in Japan and abroad. Rather than sword fittings and large scale Buddhist statuary that had previously dominated their work, they created a wide range of <I>okimono<I>, small-scale decorative sculptures. \r\n<P>One of the Chinese Taoist immortals, Gama had considerable skill in the art of herbal medicine. According to legend, he once caught a white toad while drawing water from a well, and the two became inseparable companions. In this <I>okimono<I>, Gama laughs openly while holding his toad. Like other Taoist immortals, he has rough features, unkempt hair, and ragged clothing.   \r\n",
