  "text": "Iridescent <I>Suga Silk<I> is a luxurious silk casement that originated with the Anthology collection in 1970. Larsen reformulated the colorways when the fabric joined the Great Color of China collection, adding Peach, Saffron, Aquamarine, Celadon, Puce and Carnation. These brilliant colors are brighter and clearer in tone than the muted palette of the Dunhuang murals, and served as accents to the earthier mineral hues.",
