The kagema (male prostitute), lying backwards on top of his elder partner, is dressed in a furisode decorated with irises, a flower associated with the male gender (with blade-like leaves). The chrysanthemum motif on the futon is a frequent symbol in shunga for homosexual love as the blossoms are thought to resemble the male aperture.",
