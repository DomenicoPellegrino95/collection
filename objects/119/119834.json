  "text": "Drawn from the live model, Domenic Cretara’s portrait study is an exercise in meticulous observation. Showing only her head, neck, and the suggestion of one shoulder, the study exemplifies his skill and sensitivity in representational depiction of the human figure. Here, Cretara carefully indicates the subtle variations of light and shadow that describe the forms and textures of the model’s head, face, and hair, while adeptly capturing the essence of the model’s introspective expression and elegant bearing.",
