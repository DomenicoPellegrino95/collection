  "text": "The pattern of intersecting, white curves made of lattimo threads, which are captured within the glass of this charger as though frozen in ice, visualizes precise and complex mathematical rules. At the same time, it is amazing because of its clarity, harmony and elegance, and for its craftsman's breathtaking virtuosity. It is perhaps no coincidence that in the same years when this charger was blown, Kepler and Galilei researched the trajectories of the earth and the surrounding planets.",
