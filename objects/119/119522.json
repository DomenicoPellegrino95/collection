  "text": "Shiva appears as the Lord of the Dance in a circle of fire, flanked by his son, Ganesha, and wife Bhudevi. Fanned by two celestial deities overhead, they appear underneath the gilt roof of a south Indian temple; these architectural forms mimic those from the painting’s place of origin in Tamil Nadu, southeastern India. The avatars of Vishnu and an assortment of planetary deities pay homage to the gods above, and stand between two small shrines at each corner, one devoted to the multiheaded god Brahma, and the other to the blue-skinned Vishnu.\r\n\r\nAs an object of devotion in a personal shrine, the reflective gold on this painting would have glittered in the soft candlelight provided by a devotee during prayer.",
