  "text": "To design these tapestries, Helena Hernmarck first created exuberant watercolors. She then translated these freehand paintings into wool, preserving the sense of loose brushstrokes on a very large scale. Blue Wash 1 and Blue Wash 2 are excellent examples of Hernmarck’s skill, scale, and vibrant use of color. Major abstract works of contemporary tapestry are rare in her body of work, so acquisition of these pieces is a unique opportunity for the Mia.",
