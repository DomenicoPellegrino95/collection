  "text": "Lisa Nankivil enjoys a national reputation for her luminous abstract paintings, monotypes, and original prints that explore qualities such as motion, ascendance, and hierarchy, using a single vertical or horizontal orientation as a guiding organizational method. Her approach relies on the dynamic interplay of line, color, texture, space, and light to accentuate the work’s material and subjective qualities. Working intuitively, she builds her compositions layer by layer, adding both clarity and complexity as the work progresses. As seen in this mixed-media print from 2009, her work possesses a vibrant energy produced by multiple areas of contrasting color and tone, inducing a “push and pull” visual illusion within the pictorial space. The effect invites close inspection of the work’s intricate details and surface textures. The phenomenon of optical mixing further heightens the visual intensity of the work. Formally and conceptually, the print elaborates on the intangible nature of pictorial space, evoking a range of emotional and perceptual responses.",
