  "text": "A courtesan wearing a kosode decorated with a ho-o bird embraces a man resting his head on a cushioned lacquer pillow. She is trying to appease him, apparently her last customer of the evening who has been kept waiting. He complains: \"You made me wait quite a while, haven't you' I'm not letting you go anywhere after this.\" She assures him of his importance: \"I wouldn't exchange you for the moon or the flowers. Because of you, I don't hate even my most arduous duties. Please be sure to never abandon me.\"",
