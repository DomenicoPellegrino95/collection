At left is a black and gold lacquer cabinet and portable tobacco set; at right is a panel from screen and sugoroku table. The customer has lavish praise: \"Your skin is whiter than the reflection of the rising sun on snow, and soft and smooth like white habutae silk. To touch it is indescribable.\" She encourages him: \"Oh yes, go deeper into me, and strongly. Hold me tightly. Ooh, ooh, uh, uh.\"",
