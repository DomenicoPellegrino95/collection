  "text": "In Islamic Africa, the writing board is a powerful artifact connected with education and ritual. Its primary purpose is to help students learn the holy Qur’an and the art of calligraphy. Some boards are also used by Muslim healers, who write specific verses on them and treat the water to wash off the verses as holy medicine. These colorful examples are exceptional in their representations of animals—a camel and a stylized quadruped, respectively—and were either made by teachers to give to their students as a diploma, or served as talismans at home for protection.",
