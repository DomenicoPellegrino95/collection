  "text": "Like his spice box, Belli's footed pyxis serves as a container. But the theological context and meaning could not be more different. In Catholicism, the pyxis serves as a receptacle for the consecrated host—the most sacred of entities, which requires protection from possible profanation. The decoration of the rim with four cherub's heads refers to the teaching that the liturgy performed on earth is mirrored by an angelic liturgy in heaven.",
