  "text": "In this large-scale canvas, Bulgarian-born Iva Gueorguieva combines abstracted fields of paint, cut fabric, scratches, textures, and lines in a chaotic swirl of activity and excess energy. The elements of the painting interact with such vitality that they seem to be in a constant state of metamorphosis. The overall effect of this enigmatic narrative is one of intense physicality that conjures shifting moods of anxiety, violence and heightened emotions.",
