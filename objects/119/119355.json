  "text": "With their dazzling colors and bold designs, these rugs represent the innovative approach of contemporary women weavers in Morocco. Since the 1970s a new style developed in both rural areas and small urban centers: so-called “rag rugs” made in part of recycled fabric—often remnants of used clothes. These three examples illustrate the variety of styles: one of them has only a few lines and patches made of rags to create a design, another rug displays the typical diamond shape in unusual colors, while the third rug, in black and green, has a strikingly modernist feel to it.",
