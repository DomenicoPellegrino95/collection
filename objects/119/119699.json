  "text": "Mane'emon's first encounter is to witness a calligraphy teacher taking advantage of a young pupil by forcing himself on her while promising to promote her ahead of her fellow students. She protests: \"Oh my master, please let me go.\" Mane'emon hides beneath the table and expresses his outrage at the teacher's reprehensible behavior: \"Poor girl\", and points out his large nose- a feature associated with people of an evil nature. As Mane’emon disapproves of the scene, it is left to the cats on the verandah to take up the responsibility of mimicking the action in this print.",
