  "text": "J. M. W. Turner’s ecstatic relationship to sublime nature comes alive as the deft strokes of his brush capture the changes of mood in the varying light of the turbulent scene. This personal notation, not meant for public dissemination, borders on pure abstraction, and its open center evokes Turner’s spiritual interpretation of light. Far removed from the tightly executed, picturesque works that typified British watercolors of the early 19th century, Storm at Sea, presages the freedom, immediacy, abstraction, and mysticism that became central to art produced by later generations.\r\nTurner watercolor sketches of such freedom and freshness are rarely found outside of London, since he bequeathed nearly all such personal works to the British nation.",
