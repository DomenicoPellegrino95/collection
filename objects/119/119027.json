The text describes the rules of conduct for members of the community of monks and would have been either donated to the temple by the monks themselves or faithful donors. Made from gilt lacquer and carefully inscribed in Pali using “Tamarind seed” script style, these objects were produced in abundance during the 14th-20th centuries. Its 16 glossy pages are kept between two heavily ornamented wooden covers, bearing designs of seated apsaras (winged deities) and scrolling vegetal and geometric motifs.",
