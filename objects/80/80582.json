  "text": "The painting on this vase is of exceptional quality and notable for the subtle combination of underglaze blue and copper-red pigments, which give the impression of gray in the two deer and a pinkish color in the trunk of the pine tree. This unusual technique demonstrates both the virtuosity of the painter and the skill of the kiln master, who needed to perfectly control the firing to achieve the difficult copper-red color.",
