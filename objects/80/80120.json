  "text": "After Marc Chagall completed his illustrated Bible in 1956, religious imagery flooded his art. The warrior-musician-poet David was a favorite, partly because David was the name of Chagall's brother, who died of tuberculosis in the Crimea. In the illustration for Psalm 39, an artist sits below a clock and paints David and his harp. Verse 4 begins, \"Lord, let me know my end, and what is the measure of my days.\"",
