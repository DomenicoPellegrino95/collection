  "text": "The eighty satirical images of Goya's <I>Los Caprichos<I> contain many layers of meaning and challenge the modern viewer.Ê In the first half of the book, Goya explores the themes of superstition, sensuality, greed, and violence set in the brothels, salons, and prisons of Madrid.Ê His true meanings were often disguised and the titles usually suggested multiple interpretations. The page on display shows the artist asleep at his desk with owls and other creatures of the night hovering in the background.Ê It marks a change in the book and implies that the pages that follow are fantastic images that have emerged from the artist's dreams and nightmares.Ê Even though Goya tried to veil his attacks on Spanish society, he soon withdrew the set from sale because he had been reported to the Inquisition.Ê The copy on display is a rare presentation proof filled with early printings of each etching.Ê",
