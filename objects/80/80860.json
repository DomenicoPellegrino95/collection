  "text": "Frame: Gift of the Douglas and Mary Olson Frame Acquisition Fund\r\n\r\n\r\nAlbert Moore was a principal originator of the Aesthetic Movement, which dominated the decorative and pictorial art scene in Britain and America after 1860. Also known as \"Art for Art's Sake\", Aestheticism proscribed narrative subject matter and argued that beauty of form, color and composition were the sole ends of art. His signature images of classically draped female figures, inspired by his study of the Elgin Marbles and often incorporating elements of Japanese design, would have a profound influence on James MacNeill Whistler, who considered Moore the most original artist of his generation. \r\n\r\nThe title of our picture alludes to the racket used in badminton, a game of ancient origin, yet the true \"subject\" of Moore's painting is its exquisite technical assurance, its delicious array of linear patterning, and its seductive color harmonies.\r\n\r\nThis frame is a reproduction of the original artist's frame. The present frame includes a stepped, triangular section, stylized Classical ornaments, and bead-&-astragal molding.",
