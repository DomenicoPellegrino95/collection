  "text": "Fujiwara no Hidesato was a legendary warrior said to have lived in the 10th century. Famous for his military exploits, he reportedly was asked by the dragon god, the guardian of Lake Biwa, to kill a giant centipede that was terrorizing the lake. After Hidesato accomplished the task, the dragon god invited him to his underwater palace where he presented the warrior with three gifts: a large bell, bolts of silk, and a bag of rice. Emerging from the water riding on the back of a large turtle, Hidesato is shown in this print on his way back from the visit to the underwater palace-shown in the background. Kuniyoshi's detailed depiction of the sea creatures that are swimming around Hidesato and carrying the gifts for him makes this surreal scene look surprisingly plausible. \r\n\r\n",
