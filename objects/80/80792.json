  "text": "Minnesotans are no strangers to Susan Warner's playful, sometimes provocative work.  Her large-scale ceramic tile murals and sculptures are part of the landscapes of neighborhoods throughout the Twin Cities, most notably at the University of Minnesota's St. Paul campus and the Minnesota State Fairgrounds.  \r\n\r\nSusan Warner's interest in ceramics was developed as a student at the University of Minnesota where she studied with acclaimed potter Warren MacKenzie.  Although Warner originally created functional ceramics and tiles, her work soon took on a feminist edge.  This slightly menacing clothes iron motif has been a recurring aspect of her work ever since.\r\n",
