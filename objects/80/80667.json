  "text": "1 Cent Life, Walasse Ting's celebrated artist's book was the result of a collaborative effort among Ting, expressionist painter Sam Francis, who served as the book's editor, and more than 60 artists, all friends or acquaintances of Ting and Francis. Many of these artists were relatively unknown at the time. Conceived as an international illustrated book, 1 Cent Life mirrored the various artistic currents of the day, including Abstract Expressionism, CoBrA art, and Pop art. Ting wrote 61 poems for the project, all completed during 1961. Ting's poetry is often grammatically incorrect and together with its unequal lines and seemingly disconnected ideas and imagery, mimics the sounds of his native Chinese language. In addition to Rauschenberg, the book features original prints by Francis, Ting, Andy Warhol, James Rosenquist, Joan Mitchell, Jim Dine, Claes Oldenburg, Pierre Alechinsky, Enrico Baj, Roy Lichtenstein, and others.
