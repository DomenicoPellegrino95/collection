  "description": "Listed below are the eight parts of this portfolio. Apart from the print on the cover, Roethel called the images heliogravures, but they are here described as photomechanical reproductions since they do not appear to have the etched character of heliogravures. The titles are given in English, German (as Roethel uses for his entry headings), and French (when assigned titles in the Xylographies portfolio). The original blocks were all made in 1907.\r\n\r\n2003.180a: grey paper folder cover with Roethel 70.\r\nLayout and text designed by Kandinsky\r\n[possibly a machine printed impression form the original block]\r\nLandscape with Figure and Phoenix\r\nLandschaft mit Figur und Phönix\r\n\r\n2003.180b: introductory text\r\n\r\n2003.180c: title or index page with photomechanical reproduction of Roethel 66\r\nFlame\r\nFlamme\r\n\r\n2003.180d: Photomechanical reproduction of Roethel 59\r\nClouds / Horsemen\r\nWolken\r\nChevaliers\r\n\r\n2003.180e: Photomechanical reproduction of Roethel 65\r\nBird / Birds\r\nVögel\r\nLes Oiseaux\r\n\r\n2003.180f: Photomechanical reproduction of Roethel 55\r\nChurch\r\nKirche\r\nL'Église\r\n\r\n2003.180g: Photomechanical reproduction of Roethel 54\r\nHorn / The Birches\r\nSchalmei\r\nLes Bouleaux\r\n\r\n2003.180h: Photomechanical reproduction of Roethel 60\r\nWomen in the Forest \r\nFrauen im Wald\r\nLes Femmes au Bois",
