  "text": "\"Operation Sea Lion\" was the code name for Nazi Germany's plan to invade Britain during World War II. This operation, originally set for 1940, called for a massive convergence of German naval forces in a coordinated crossing of the English Channel to overwhelm and defeat British defense forces. The operation was eventually deemed unfeasible by the German High Command and was cancelled by Adolf Hitler. In this monumental artist's book, German artist Anselm Kiefer blends stark photographic images of symbol-laden \"historical scenes\" he created in his studio with actual wartime photographs that serves as a sarcastic visual commentary on the profane realities and ineptitude of the German military during World War II.  Kiefer's bathtub war game scenarios are potent and ironic references to a tragic episode of German history and culture. In this, he also explores his own identity and heritage.",
