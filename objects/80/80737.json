  "text": "From MIA-organized \"Cover Story\" Exhibition:\r\nBinding by Anselm Kiefer\r\nGerman, born 1945\r\nOil and acrylic on boards, hand-painted\r\nDate: 1975\r\n:Operation Sea Lion\" was the code name for Nazi Germany's plan for a military invasion of Britain during World War II. This operation, originally set for 1940, called for a massive convergence of German naval forces in a coordinated crossing of the English Channel to overwhelm and defeat British defense forces. The operation was deemed infeasible by the German High Command and was eventually cancelled by Adolf Hitler. Kiefer's monumental artist's book is a mocking indictment of Germany's efforts to invade and destroy Britain. The blackened and roughly textured surfaces of Kiefer's hand-painted covers strongly evoke the scorched earth in the aftermath of battle, a palpable allusion to the immense destruction and degradation of warfare.",
