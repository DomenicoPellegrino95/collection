  "text": "This early and rare club features incised images that provide a glimpse into important aspects of traditional Anishinabe spirituality. A horned figure carved into the top on the opposite side may represent Maymaygwayshi, a spirit being often portrayed as a trickster in Anishinabe stories. He loves fish, and has a habit of stealing them from Anishinaabe traps. Two-horned snake-like images below Maymaygwayshi probably represent horned serpents, called Underwater Panthers, which control water forces. A ceremonial drum is carved between these figures.",
