  "text": "Few textiles from the Moche culture have survived Northern Peruâ€™s damp climate intact, but expressive ceramics offer clues about the textile tradition. In detailed painted designs, Moche artists represented people of high status wearing luxurious patterned garments while commoners wore plain clothing. Vessels like this jar, depicting an elite couple dining on seafood, were too elaborate for daily use and were likely reserved for ceremonial occasions and for inclusion in burials.",
