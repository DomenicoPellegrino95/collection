  "text": "The rose is a common motif used for appliquéd and pieced quilts, with as many as thirty rose-related block patterns appearing in historical quilt sources. The <I>Whig Rose<I> pattern was very popular in the mid-nineteenth century, and was originally called the  <I>Democratic Rose<I>, reflecting it's association with two early American political parties, the Whigs and the Democrats, each claiming the pattern as their own. <P>\r\nThis quilt is unusual for its bright yellow ground, which makes a striking contrast to the red and green color scheme. The use of two distinct variations of the block pattern contributes to its visual interest and attests to its creator's inventiveness.\r\n",
