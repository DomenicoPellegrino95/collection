  "text": "Many northern Plains women made beaded amulets that contained their child's umbilicus. It is said that this type of amulet maintains the sacred connection between mother and child. When the child is young, the amulet is often used as a toy. When the child becomes and adult, the mother keeps the item and occasionally wears it on her belt, indicating her accomplishment of raising a good child. When an amulet is traded or sold, the umbilicus is usually removed.",
