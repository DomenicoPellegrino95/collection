  "text": "Traditionally, pots in Acoma Pueblo were made of local clays and decorated with pigments found in the surrounding environment.  This one is colored with the warm earth tones popular among Acoma artists at the time of its creation.  Designs were painted on the vessels with brushes made of yucca, a native plant.  After the pot dried it was fired, which bound the pigment to the clay, turning the vessel and its decoration into a physically integrated whole.  \r\nThe shape of this historic pot identifies it as a water jar, made to be carried on the head.  The potter formed it to facilitate this use; building features such as the high shoulder and the base that slopes gently inward, both for easier balance.  The neck curves in as well, both to fit the hand for ease of carrying, but also to slow evaporation.  \r\n",
