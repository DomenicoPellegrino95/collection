  "text": "The artificial Mount Tenpō is a famous scenic spot of Osaka. It was created by dredging the Aji River in 1831. Mount Tenpō included cherry trees and many restaurants and this scene here is indicated to be from a lookout point overseeing the Aji River. As an entertainment, people can go through two thick pillars with a hole, an auspicious tradition known from the Great Buddha Hall of the Tōdai Temple in Nara, or from a scene in Jippensha Ikku's (1766-1831) <i>Strolling along the Tōkaidō</i> (<i>Tōkaidōchū hizakurige</i>), a comic novel about the misadventures of two travelers.",
