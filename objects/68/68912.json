  "text": "Minamoto no Yoshitsune (1159-89), a valiant warrior and a charismatic leader, was heading to the west in order to avoid a military conflict with his distrustful brother when he arrived at Daimotsu Beach in 1185. As soon as Yoshitsune and his men sailed out to sea, a sudden furious storm arose. Although Yoshitsune survived the ordeal, he lost many of his soldiers. People attributed this incident to the ghosts of the enemy warriors who had been killed by Yoshitsune's army during a sea battle that had taken place not far from Daimotsu Beach several months before. Kuniyoshi depicted the imaginary battle under the water. Crabs possessed by the troubled sprits, suggested by the human faces that appear on their shells, are attacking one of Yoshitsune's retainers who have fallen overboard into the turbulent sea.   ",
