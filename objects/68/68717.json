  "text": "Charles Philipon, editor and publisher of La Caricature, first took note of the resemblance between the jowly Louis-Philippe and a plump pear, slang in French for a simpleton or a dope. This inspired discovery led to numerous pear-influenced caricatures by Daumier. The ripe pear in the middle of this print symbolizes the king. Surrounding him are fourteen masks representing members of the Legislative Assembly. The risk of being charged with causing offence to the person of the king forced caricaturists to blur or distort Louis-Philippe's features when drawing him as a pear. ",
