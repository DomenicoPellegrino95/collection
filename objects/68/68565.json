  "text": "The introduction of Mahayana (\"Greater Vehicle\") Buddhism into China had a tremendous effect on Taoism. Taoist writers began to reproduce the narrative style of Buddhist writings and to develop deities such as this in imitation of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas of the Buddhist pantheon. The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning was seen as the source of all Taoist teachings. When the deity first revealed his teachings, the blind regained their sight and the deaf were able to hear. This classic depiction of the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning depicts the deity in rich, silken garments, eyes downcast with hand raised in teaching discourse. This bronze sculpture was most likely made as one of a set of the three celestial worthies (similar to the paintings behind) intended for use on an altar table such as this one.",
