  "text": "A popular Chan (Buddhist) personality, Hanshan is known mainly through the Tang dynasty (618-906) anthology <I>Cold Mountain Poems<I> (<I>Hanshan shi<I>). The poems describe the amiable hermit as wearing simple clothing and living a carefree life as a wanderer on Cold Mountain (<I>Hanshan<I>). An unkempt Hanshan is shown sitting cross-legged, holding a brush beneath a tree tangled with vines. The inkstone and scroll on the ground beside him identify him as a poet. While Hanshan had a Buddhist outlook, he is shown here wearing a girdle of leaves carrying a double gourd, accessories associated with the Daoist immortals. Hanshan, in fact, followed popular Daoist practices and his poetry makes a number of references to philosophical and religious Daoism as well as the quest for long life and immortality. Hanshan was considered a <I>san sheng<I> or \"saintly person of unofficial status.\"",
