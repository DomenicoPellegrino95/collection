  "text": "A popular Chan (Buddhist) personality, Han-shan is known mainly through the T'ang dynasty (618-906) anthology <I>Cold Mountain Poems<I> (<I>Han-Shan Shih<I>). The poems describe the amiable hermit as wearing simple clothing and living a carefree life as a wanderer on Cold Mountain (<I>Han-shan<I>). An unkempt Han-shan is shown sitting cross-legged, holding a brush beneath a tree tangled with vines. The inkstone and scroll on the ground beside him identify him as a poet. While Han-shan had a Buddhist outlook, he is shown here wearing a girdle of leaves carrying a double gourd, accessories associated with the Taoist immortals. Han-shan, in fact, followed popular Taoist practices and his poetry makes a number of references to philosophical and religious Taoism as well as the quest for long life and immortality. Han-shan was considered a <I>san sheng<I> or \"saintly person of unofficial status.\"\r\n<BR>\r\n<P>This painting has been attributed on stylistic grounds to Chiang Kuei, a follower of the Che school master of wet-ink painting Wu Wei (1459-1508).",
