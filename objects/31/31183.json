  "text": "Among the most popular deities of Tibetan Buddhism, the Green Tara (<I>Sgrol-ma Ljang-gu<I>) is worshipped as a female bodhisattva representing the embodiment of infinite compassion. Remarkable for its size and age, most of this statue is made from separate pieces of hammered sheet copper (repouss√© technique) fastened together with rivets. Certain features like the crown, hands, and earrings are cast bronze. Although the lower legs are missing, the bejeweled goddess sits in <I>lalitasana<I>, the posture of relaxation, wherein the left leg would have rested parallel to the base while the right leg was pendant. Her right hand, opened in the <I>varada<I>, or \"gift bestowing\" mudra, originally rested on her right knee. The deity's left hand once held the stem of a lotus which blossomed at her shoulder.",
