Rio, 2/24/2016)\r\n\r\nPortrait of Master Dongpo in Wide-Brimmed Hat and Sandals\r\n\r\nMy mind is like a log turned to ashes, my body like an unanchored boat.\r\nWere someone to ask what my life\\'s work is, [I would say] Huangzhou, Tanzhou, and Huizhou. When the master journeyed to the Red Cliff, he composed an incomparable prose-poem. The cool breeze and bright moon are the same now as then, in autumn, the seventh month of 1082. What does the disciple love about these thousand autumns? Memories of 1082 are numerous. If the spirit wandering the Red Cliff is responsive, from the tip of my brush will emerge hundreds of Su Dongpo\\'s. \r\n\r\nFourteen [sexagenary] cycles have passed since Su journeyed to the Red Cliff. Many generations later, I am thrilled by this unexpected occasion, on this the 27th day of the fifth month of 1922...\r\n",
