  "text": "Among all African cultures, the Yaka are specifically known for their unique headrest designs.  They include a variety of shapes and designs as well as carvings of animals, humans, and structures.  The house motif depicted on this headrest is representative of the domestic unit in Yaka society, which is vital to bringing people together and building community.  The images used on headrests are often inspired by dreams, which are highly valued by the Yaka and are connected to the spiritual power of their headrests.",
