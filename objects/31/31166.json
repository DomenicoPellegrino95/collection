  "text": "Standard ritual bronzes cast for the altar comprise five vessels <I>(wu kang)<I>, a censer, two candlesticks, and a pair of vases. The pair of candlesticks shown here are part of a five-piece imperial garniture whose remaining three pieces, a censer and pair of vases, are now on view in the Wu family reception hall. Ritual bronze vessels like these, made for the imperial palaces and temples, were governed by state regulations under a section titled, \"Rules for Making Sacrificial Vessels and Ornaments for Temple Use.\" The archaistic d√©cor including <I>t'ao-t'ieh<I> masks and cicada blades against a spiral ground is a revival of a Sung dynasty (960-1279) style which was itself an interpretation of ancient Shang and Chou (16th c.-221 B.C.) ritual bronzes. Each vessel of this large and important set bears the six-character reign mark of the Yung-cheng emperor (1723-35) and the censer and candlesticks bear the additional characters <I>ching chih<I> (made with reverence).",
