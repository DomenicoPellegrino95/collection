  "text": "This bronze image of a crowned Buddha in the pose of meditation (<I>dhyanamudra<I>) represents Amoghasiddi, one of the five transcendental Buddhas of the Vajrayana pantheon. The system of esoteric Buddhism known as Vajrayana evolved a hierarchy with the supreme (<I>Adi<I>) Buddha at the top, from whose meditations emerged the five transcendental Buddhas, each of which was associated with a direction. The Buddha Amoghasiddi represents the north. \r\n<P>Made around 1300, this statue relates stylistically to images made in the Shalen Monastery in Central Tibet. It belongs to an early tradition of sophisticated casting imbued with a spirit of naturalism and fine proportions. The style derives from Pala Indian Buddhist sculpture of the tenth and eleventh centuries.",
