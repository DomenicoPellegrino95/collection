  "text": "Standard ritual bronzes cast for the altar comprise five vessels <I>(wu kang)<I>, a censer, two candlesticks, and a pair of vases. Early woodblock prints depict these objects formally arranged in a line across the altar table with the censer used as a centerpiece flanked by candlesticks with the vases at the two ends. Ritual bronze vessels like these, made for the imperial palaces and temples, were governed by state regulations under a section titled, \"Rules for Making Sacrificial Vessels and Ornaments for Temple Use.\" The archaistic d√©cor including <I>t'ao-tieh<I> masks and cicada blades against a spiral ground is a revival of a Sung dynasty (960-1279) style which was itself an interpretation of ancient Shang and Chou (16th c.-221 B.C.) ritual bronzes. Each vessel of this large and important set bears the six character reign mark of the Yung-cheng emperor (1723-35) and the censer and candlesticks bear the additional characters <I>ching chih<I> (made with reverence).",
