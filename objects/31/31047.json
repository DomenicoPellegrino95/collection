  "text": "The famous metalworker Hu-Wen-ming from Sung-chiang, Kiangsu province (near Shanghai), was one of the most accomplished craftsmen of the late Ming dynasty. He specialized in gilt bronze ritual vessels for the incense stand and scholar's desk. His work was highly regarded by the educated elite of the wealthy Sung-chiang district. This vase bears an incised four character inscription on the bottom identifying it as work by Hu or, more properly, from his workshop. A complete set of incense vessels comprises only three items: the censer, the covered box, and the vase to hold the small metal tools required for burning the aromatic wood.",
