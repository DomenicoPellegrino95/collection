  "text": "Lidded ceramic jars often decorated with auspicious symbols like bats, flowers, and dragons were used during the warm months to house crickets. The clay walls acted as a buffer against summer heat and helped maintain the cool even temperature the insects required. Smaller clay sleeping boxes with open ends and a lidded top were placed within the jar. The largest jar shown here was used as an arena for cricket fighting contests. A variety of ceramic feeding dishes, some plain, others decorated were standard accoutrements.",
