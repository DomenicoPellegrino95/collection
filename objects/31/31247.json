  "text": "This model represents the original design for the Minneapolis Institute of Arts (MIA). Facing the front entrance, the neoclassical Beaux Arts architecture characteristics are evident: symmetrical sections and a stair leading to a porch with columns topped by a triangular pediment. The wing to the right included an orchestra hall, and the wing to the left a sculpture hall. The semi-circular projection housed offices. As built in 1915, MIA was one-seventh of this plan, comprising the monumental entrance and the rectilinear section facing 24th Street. \r\nThe Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts, MIAâ€™s parent organization founded in 1883, began fundraising for the museum in 1910. The Society held a competition for a design in 1911-1912, won by McKim, Mead, and White. This presentation model was meant to get potential donors excited about the museum. It can be pulled apart using the handles to examine different elements.\r\nStanding in front of the model, turn around and look through the Architecture and Design Gallery, and through the large window. The stone facade of the original building meets one of the white tile-covered 1974 additions designed by Kenzo Tange, where the model is now. Tange designed the additions as modern versions of the two 1911 wings proposed in the model.  ",
