  "text": "Theophilus Ni Anum Sowlah is the chief craftsman of a coffin workshop in Ghana. His West African community has a tradition of creating burial coffins which are sculptures reflecting a strong personal interest of the deceased individual. Sowah specializes in making coffins in forms of everyday objects that have included replicas of cars, vegetables, animals and other forms, depending on the wishes of the family of the deceased. Sowlah also uses his talents to create sculptures for everyday enjoyment. This walleye box was given to the Institute in recognition of Minnesota's sport fishing tradition, and is on display in celebration of the fishing opener.\r\n\n\r\n\n",
