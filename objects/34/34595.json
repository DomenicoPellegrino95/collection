  "text": "This nkisi nkondi, like the smaller figure behind it, combines powers of healing and punishment. The nails and blades, which sealed agreements and commitments made over time, served as a historical record of the community that relied upon the power figure to maintain social harmony. Large nkisi nkondi like this one were sometimes taken to a crossroads outside the village where, according to Yombe ideas about the world, the living and the supernatural cross paths. The figuresâ€™ position at opposite corners within the case, and the location of the case at the intersection of two gallery entrances, evokes the importance of this concept in Kongo and Yombe cosmology.",
