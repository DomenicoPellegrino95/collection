  "text": "By the beginning of the 17th century, beautifully decorated mirror stands with drawers for cosmetic boxes and accessories were a standard part of a highborn woman's trousseau. The simple, yet dramatic, technique of placing bold designs in gold against a lustrous black background was the hallmark of Kodaiji lacquerware, a style that evolved in the late 16th century. While Kodaiji lacquer often displays exuberant designs which nearly cover the surface of the object, later examples based on the Kodaiji style, such as this cosmetic assemblage, are more reserved and elegant. Here, the artist created a fluid, asymmetrical design based on a blossoming clematis vine.",
