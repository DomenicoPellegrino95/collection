  "text": "Trained as a painter in Chicago, Paris, and New York, Biederman began his signature experiments with aluminum relief sculpture after moving to southeast Minnesota in 1942. #26, Redwing 1956-68 is an exploration of layered abstraction in geometric form and color. Biederman layered squares and rectangles shapes one atop or next to another, creating a multiplicity of shadows, planes, and color contrasts that shift as one walks around the piece. It's likely that Biederman drew inspiration for this piece from his home in Red Wing, a picturesque town on the Mississippi River. ",
