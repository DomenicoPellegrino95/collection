  "text": "At first glance, this print seems to depict a bride. The white headdress and elaborately patterned gown with a train are typical of a Japanese bride's outfit. The bride shown here, however, is highly unusual. The furry face peeking out from beneath the headdress is that of a monkey rather than a woman. It may illustrate one of many Japanese folktales involving marriages between humans and animals, or it may simply represent the mischievous nature of the monkey. Whichever the case, it is sweetly comical with the monkey's hairy foot and curled toes protruding beneath the hem of the dress. \r\n\r\n",
