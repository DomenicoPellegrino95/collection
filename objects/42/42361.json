  "text": "Originally performed in China, <I>manzai<I> entertainment in Japan consisted of lively and often comical blessings sung to the accompaniment of the <I>kotsuzumi<I>, or small drum held on the shoulder. Traveling door to door at New Year, <I>manzai<I> dancers were welcomed at house and palace alike, where their exaggerated gestures, lighthearted puns, and felicitous exclamations of \"<I>Manzai! Manzai!<I>\" (long life, long life) were a source of great amusement. Here, the connection between Hiroshige's view of Akasaka and Kunisada's depiction of two <I>manzai<I> dancers is linked through the symbolism of the pine tree. Since pine trees live to great age, they became emblematic of longevity. Thus, one of the <I>manzai<I> dancers holds a fan decorated with pine trees. Playing off this idea, Hiroshige pictured Akasaka, renowned for its ancient pines.",
