  "description": "label copy This page exhibits examples of the sort of modifications and later additions commonly found in illuminated manuscripts. The seven days of creation, as related in the first book of Genesis, are depicted in roundels in descendant order. This cycle of scenes is traditionally used on the antiphonal page for the service of matins on Septuagesima Sunday. Indeed the words 'inseptuagesima.ad mat.' appear in the red rubric of instructions.    The uppermost miniature showing God the Father seperating light from darkness, is a repair, perhaps requires to replace an illuminator's error. It is painted on a seperate section of vellum cut to fit and affixed with tape on the reverse. This miniature is further distinguished by its architectural frame. The frames of the other six miniatures are joined in loop fashion to form the letter 'I' which takes the shape of a column. Below, an historiated initial 'C' depicting a kneeling angel holding a frond, is a later addition its edges clearly overlap the music and text. Since the figure in this miniature is stylistically similar to the others, it was apparently appropriated from elsewhere in the book. The cropped body of the dragon at the bottom indicates that this page has also been trimmed.",
