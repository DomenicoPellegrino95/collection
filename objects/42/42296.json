  "text": "Shitakiri-suzume, or \"Tongue-cut Sparrow\" is a well-known Japanese folktale. It involves a kind old man and his coldhearted wife. After finding his pet sparrow has flown away because his wife cut its tongue as punishment for misbehavior, the old man went searching the bird in the forest. He was greeted by a group of sparrows that were dressed like humans. Appreciating his concern and kindness for the injured bird, they entertained him with a feast, during which they sang and danced for him. \r\nThis print shows the old man holding the claw of a sparrow, at the moment when he arrived at the sparrows' secret community in the forest. Wearing a white headdress and a long-sleeved kimono, the bird in this print looks like an elegant young lady. The old man himself, a humbled farmer in the original story, is dressed like a wealthy retiree. In fact, it may be a portrait of the gentleman who commissioned the print as a backdrop for verses by members of his poetry society. \r\n",
