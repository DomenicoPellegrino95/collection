  "text": "This print depicts a \"meandering stream party\" (kyokusui no en). In ancient China, parties were sometimes held along the banks of narrow streams. Cups filled with wine were floated down the stream. Participants were required to compose poems before the cups passed by. Those who failed to do so were required to drink a cup of wine. In this print, three people in the lower left are the guests. The man seated between the two women is hurriedly re-reading his poem as a small wine cup approaches.  In the upper right, a young boy diligently places cups into the stream. The man seated next to him resembles Fukusuke, a big-headed doll that is associated with a good luck and a business success.   \r\n\r\n",
