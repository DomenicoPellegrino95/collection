  "text": "Originally performed as part of a Shinto ritual, sumø had developed into a popular form of public entertainment by the nineteenth century. Held on the grounds of temples and shrines, sumø attracted large crowds and the clergy benefitted from ticket sales-making them much anticipated community events.  Wrestlers traveled all over the country, but regularly competed in the three major cities of Edo (today's Tokyo), Kyoto, and Osaka. Since all the poems included in this print refer to things associated with autumn, it must have commemorated a sumø match held in that season. The large wrestler is getting dressed in a red and white ceremonial apron, which is worn for a ritual performed by ranking wrestlers before the day's bouts start. Another wrestler, presumably of lower rank, helps him secure the apron.  ",
