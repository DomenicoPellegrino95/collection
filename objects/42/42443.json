  "text": "Wisteria blooms in late spring and is one of the most beloved flowers in Japan. As a woody vine, it is often trained to cover arbors constructed in temples and shrines. The long, pendulous racemes hanging over these structures create a spectacular display. Here, the artist shows a spray of wisteria with a common sparrow, a sight one might enjoy while seated in an arbor.  Køno Bairei, an artist whose artistic lineage descends from the great 18th century naturalist painter Maruyama Økyo (1733-95), depicted the sparrow and wisteria in astonishing detail.",
