  "text": "During New Year's holiday, itinerant puppeteers performed for delighted crowds of children. The earliest puppeteers were associated with Ebisu shrine in Hy√∏go prefecture, causing this style of puppetry to be called Ebisu-mawashi (wanderers from Ebisu). Hiding their hands behind a large rectangular box suspended from their necks, Ebisu-mawashi puppeteers skillfully worked the dolls on the box-top stage. The show always ended with the appearance of a weasel, whose furry fake tail suddenly popped out of the box, playfully startling the children. The little boy dressed in a red kimono in this picture, however, is delighted by this trick and excitedly points at the puppet on the box while his mother looks on. ",
