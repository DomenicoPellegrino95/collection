  "text": "The eighty etched plates of Goya's seminal publication Los Caprichos contain many layers of meaning and challenge the modern viewer's understanding of these images. In the first half of the book, Goya explores  themes of superstition, sensuality, greed, and violence set in the brothels, salons, and prisons of Madrid. His true meanings were often disguised and the titles of the prints usually suggested multiple interpretations. Midway through the book the artist is shown asleep at his desk with owls and other creatures of the night emerging in the background (Plate 43, “The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters”). This plate, which was originally intended as the series' frontispiece, marks a change in the book and implies that the pages that follow are fantastic images that originated from the artist's dreams and nightmares. Even though Goya tried to veil his satrical attacks on Spanish society, he soon withdrew the set from sale because he had been reported to the Inquisition. The MIA’s copy of Los Capricos is a rare presentation set, one of only seven known to exist, featuring early impressions taken from each plate.",
