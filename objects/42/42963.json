  "text": "Best known for his monumental sculptures, Henry Moore had a lifelong fascination with the motif of the reclining figure. In Multicolored Reclining Figure, 1967, he uses this motif to explore formal ideas–“things that he doesn’t yet know about for certain but wants to experiment with”– through the interconnection of various shapesand colors. Working between realism and abstraction, he explored its expressive form throughout his career in innumerable drawings, prints, and sculptures.",
