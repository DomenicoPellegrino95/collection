Since New Year's typically occurred in spring according to the traditional lunar calendar, these flowers came to be emblematic of renewal and regeneration in Japan. Housewives would cut branches from the trees, as seen here, and bring them indoors where the buds would open to form a festive decoration for New Year's celebrations.",
