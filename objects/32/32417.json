  "text": "Daikoku and Fukurokuju are included among the Seven Gods of Good Fortune. Daikoku is associated with agriculture and is worshiped as a god of the fields. Fukurokuju, the god of longevity, is distinguished by his extremely elongated cranium, probably meant to suggest the vast wisdom he accumulated over his long life. \r\n<P>As demand for religious imagery decreased, O_tsu-e artists turned to secular, often humorous subjects. Here Daikoku, attempts to shave Fukurokuju's impossibly tall head. Gripping a small razor in his right hand, he worriedly goes about his work. Fukurokuju. holding a bowl to catch the hairs as they fall, peers up skeptically at his earnest companion.",
