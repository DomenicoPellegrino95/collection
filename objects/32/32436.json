  "text": "Distinguished by its attenuated profile, the deep bowl of this food offering vessel is set on a high foot with matching cover to form a sphere. The upper half has three slender faceted projections to serve as tripod legs when the cover is inverted for use as a bowl. All elements are decorated with fine linear scroll motifs, fretwork patterns, and triangular panels that vaguely recall earlier bronze styles and motifs. With the dispersal of wealth and political authority during late Chou, the number of local foundries increased and workshops developed regional styles. Eclecticism was a hallmark of the era, and artisans looked to their own past in reviving certain elements of zoomorphic d√©cor like the cicada-inspired triangle panels seen here. A similar <I>tou<I> to this one was discovered in the Warring States tomb at Tung-hsien near Peking in 1981. Another related vessel was discovered in 1959 in Huai-jou county north of Peking.",
