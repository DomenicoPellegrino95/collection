  "text": "Before his first major use of the gouache cut-out medium in producing Jazz, Matisse had created complete cut-out compositions that were lithographically reproduced as covers, title pages, or frontispieces for several issues of art journals, the most notable being Verve. The publisher of Verve was Matisse’s Greek friend, Tériade (Efstratios Eleftheriades), who encouraged Matisse’s use of the new medium.",
