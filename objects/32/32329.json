  "text": "Highly decorated raffia skirts are important prestige objects created and worn by both men and women in Kuba society. They are essential parts of elaborate costumes worn on ceremonial occasions and are also used in funerary rituals. This example is a small portion of the original skirt, which may have measured up to twenty-five feet in length. Women's skirts are wrapped around the body several times and are often secured with a short overskirt decorated with cut-pile embroidery. \r\n\r\nIn Kuba society, the process of making textiles is as important as the finished textiles themselves. The creation of a woman's skirt is coordinated by a clan matriarch who procures the materials, determines the overall design, and distributes panels of cloth to other women in her clan. The individual pieces are decorated with appliqué and embroidery and returned to the matriarch for assembly. The process is much like that of an American Friendship quilt, with the end product reflecting the aesthetic sensibilities and skill levels of the many women involved.\r\n",
