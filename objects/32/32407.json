Devotion to Amida and recitation of his name at the moment of death assure the faithful of rebirth in western Paradise, where sentient souls can strive toward enlightenment without the pain and suffering associated with earthly life. \r\n<P>This painting shows Amida descending from the heavens to receive the soul of a dying devotee. Known as <I>raigo_<I>, or Welcoming Descent, such works vividly illustrate Amida's boundless compassion.",
