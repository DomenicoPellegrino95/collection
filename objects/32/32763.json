Philosophically anti-naturalist, it includes discussions of folk art and children's drawings, as well as contributions by other artists in various fields, including drawings and an article on music by Arnold Sch√∂nberg. The celebrated Blue Rider Group derived its name from this publication by two of its founders.",
