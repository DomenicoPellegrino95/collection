  "text": "The Japanese have long delighted in the idea of animals parodying human actions. In this painting, the cat daintily offers a hot pepper with his chopsticks, knowing that it will make the foolish mouse gulp his sake. Oblivious of danger, the mouse tips the red and black cup to his lips. In the foreground stands a double gourd, used to decant the strong rice wine that is the cause of the mouse's reckless abandon and, ultimately, the cat's good fortune. The inscriptions reinforce the moralistic theme of the work: disaster awaits those who forget themselves and drink too much: \r\n\r\n<P><I>More than just deceived, [the mouse]<I>\r\n<P><I>gleefully dances, and then is caught<I>\r\n\r\n<P><I>The mind that does not heed danger<I>\r\n<P><I>causes the body to be caught<I>\r\n\r\n<P><I>Unwittingly befriended by the cat<I>\r\n<P><I>who plies him with sake<I>\r\n<P><I>the mouse drinks, slurp, slurp<I>\r\n\r\n<P><I>Those who imitate the sages' teachings<I>\r\n<P><I>will eventually ruin others' lives.<I>",
