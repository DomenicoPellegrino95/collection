  "text": "The German artist Max Ernst was a pioneering figure of the Dada and Surrealist movements of the early 20th century. Among his many achievements, he collaborated with American artist Man Ray in developing the photogram, essentially a photograph made without the need for a camera or lens. The photograms featured in this artist's book were made by combining frottage (textural rubbings) and line drawings on sheets of thin translucent paper, then using those sheets of paper as photographic negatives to create a reverse image on photosensitive paper. The text is Kay Boyle's English translation of the first chapter of René Crevel's novel Babylone (1927).",
