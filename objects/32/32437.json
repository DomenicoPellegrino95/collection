  "text": "The Five Dynasties (907-960) and Sung (960-1279) period saw a tremendous increase in the production of fine white porcelaneous wares. During the preceding T'ang dynasty (618-907), kilns located at Ch'i-ts'un in Lin chang district of Hopei province developed the refined Hsing works that are considered the forerunners of the classic white Ting wares of the Sung dynasty. This delicate, thinly potted dish bears a precisely molded floral design that is probably based on the decoration found on contemporary silver utensils. It is a well-preserved example of early Sung white ware.",
