Eighty acres of the family farm were lost to foreclosure in the 1980's. The book combines photography and oral history to explore memories of the area as it is and was. Accompanying quotations from other sources provide additional context on contemporary farm issues. Produced with a fellowship from the Jerome Foundation and the Minnesota Center for Book Arts.\r\n\r\n\"These were created during the 'farm crisis' in the late 80's when long-term farm families were losing their land to bank foreclosures. These were times when farmers and farm histories were being lost to suicide and bankruptcy. Many foreclosures were not because of poor financial managing by farm families, but by bank practices which resulted in whole families losing land that had meaning beyond just money.\"\r\n\r\n\"We believe that art should be connected and have social relevance.\"\r\n",
