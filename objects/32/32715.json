  "text": "Ken Campbell and David King confront the ruthless brutality of the corrupt Soviet regime under Communist dictator Joseph Stalin (1879-1953). Their artist's book was modeled after a 1934 government-commissioned commemorative album of the same title designed by the Russian avant-garde artist Aleksandr Rodchenko (1891-1956).  Originally designed to observe a decade of Soviet rule in the Republic of Uzbekistan, Rodchenko's publication featured a series of photographs of Uzbek government functionaries, along with positive but questionable statistics demonstrating the regime's successes. By the time the book was issued, many of these same party and government officials had fallen out of favor with Moscow and were purged and summarily executed on Stalin's orders. To avoid suspicions about his own loyalty to the regime, Rodchenko felt compelled to engage in self-censorship, blackening out the names and faces of the murdered men and women in his copy of the book. In recreating and supplementing aspects of Rodchenko's album, Campbell and King give a sense of the power of tyranny and its devastating human consequences. ",
