  "text": "<I>Oni<I> are horned, fanged, and generally ferocious demons whose actions range from the truly sinister to the benignly humorous. This one wears the black robes of a Buddhist priest. With a brass gong hung around his neck, a small hammer in his right hand, and a list of followers in his left, he chants the <I>nembutsu<I>, an invocation to Amida Buddha for the salvation of all souls. \r\n<P>The Japanese reveled in the simple humor of such unlikely juxtapositions as a demon masquerading as a priest. These popular images of demons often served as signboards for the painting shops that line the streets of the towns of O_tsu and Oiwake.",
