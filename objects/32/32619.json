  "text": "In the first decades of Islam, the divine revelation was transmitted by oral tradition. Following the death of Prophet Muhammad in 632 CE, the Qur'an had to be written down to secure it. For Muslims worldwide, Arabic, the language of the Qur'an, holds a special significance and is believed to be sacred. Regardless of what language they speak, Muslims are taught to read the Qur'an in Arabic. In this portable Qur'an from Persia, we see a beautifully ornamented double frontispiece with calligraphy in black, gold, and red. In conformity with Muslim avoidance of human and animal figuration, notably in religious contexts, the decorations consist of floral motifs and geometrical patterns.",
