  "text": "Drawings by the Italian frescoist Pasquale Cati are rare. This is a design for one of the 22 paintings he executed for the ceiling of the Altemps Chapel in Santa Maria in Trastevere in Rome. The design's irregular shape relates to its placement in the vaulted ceiling. The ostensible subject is Christ's circumcision; yet, the large foreground figures, shown in eye-catching poses, dominate the scene. Such reversals of emphasis are in part why Roman fresco decoration of the time is described as being Mannerist.\r\n\r\nImage Caption\r\nVault of the Altemps Chapel, Santa Maria in Trastevere, Rome\r\n",
