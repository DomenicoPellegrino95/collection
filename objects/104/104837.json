  "text": "The Dakota or the Metis tribe created this cape; both are known for their exquisite floral beadwork. With its interconnecting abstract flowers and leaves, the beadwork reflects a combination of Great Lakes/Woodlands and Plains floral styles.  The original purpose of this object is not entirely clear.  It may have been created for a woman, but many Metis men in Canada wore coats that incorporated a cape, and this object may have been recycled from such a coat.  \r\n",
