  "text": "In 1793, an illness left Spanish court painter, Francisco Goya profoundly deaf, a condition that may have liberated him to explore unconventional subjects in his art. A few years later, he published Los Caprichos, a set of 80 etchings and aquatints that delved into prostitution, superstition, religious exploitation, abuse of power, witchcraft, and other follies of Spanish society. Though Goya took care to keep his imagery somewhat inscrutable, avoiding specific reference to individuals, the prints proved so inflammatory that they were withdrawn from sale within fifteen days. The print on display refers to the custom of arranged marriages in Spain.  ",
