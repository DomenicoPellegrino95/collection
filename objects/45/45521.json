  "text": "Huang Ting, also known as K'uang-t'ing and Tu Wang-k'o, was from Ch'ang-shu in Kiangsu Province. Like many Châ€™ing orthodox painters, he was influenced by the aesthetic theories of Tung Ch'i-ch'ang (1555-1636) and he studied the landscape of Sung and Yuan masters. Signed paintings by Huang cite the styles of Tung Yuan (c. 900-962), Ni Tsan (1301-1374), and Tung Ch'i-ch'ang as inspiring his own work.\r\n<P>This simply composed, dry-brush landscape featuring a \"one corner\" foreground composition with a stand of bare trees and a scholar's hut separated from distant mountains by a tilted water plane suggested by blank paper is a compositional formula first popularized by the great 14th century literatus Ni Tsan. Huang captures the character of the antique in this work by absorbing the compositional elements and dry brush technique of earlier masters.",
