  "text": "Barrel-form stools with four, five, or six openings were very popular during Ming (1368-1644) and are among the most pleasing forms in classical Chinese furniture. The slender ribs, large openings, and unobtrusive joinery combine to create an elegant, light, and airy space-frame. Few pairs of Ming-style barrel-form stools in fine hardwood have survived, however, and this rare, exceptionally well-crafted set is distinguished by its round marble seats with their bold, natural patterns evocative of mountain landscapes. The precision of the bridle and tenon joinery is highly refined and each of the curved sections fit together with remarkable accuracy, imparting a sense of structural continuity and visual harmony.\r\n",
