  "text": "Yonten Gyalpo is a dharmapala or \"protector of the religion\". He is one of the five Great Kings, the Gyalpo Kunga who are protectors of the Tibetan government and of Buddhism.\r\n<P>This exquisitely painted dark ground thanka shows a red Yonten Gyalpo on the center wearing a cane hat and riding a black horse. In his outstretched right hand he holds a <I>vajra<I>, in his left hand a skull cup. Three monks are in clouds above his head indicating that the thanka belongs to the Gelugpa tradition. Beneath Yonten Gyalpo are other protective deities and members of the Tibetan pantheon astride various animals including the mythical <I>Chi-lin<I>, horse, elephant, white lion, and tiger. All the figures are set against green and blue cloud scrolls or flame designs, carefully outlined in gold. The brushwork of this small painting is exceptionally well rendered with fine detail and precise gold work. Its condition with original silk mounts and well-preserved surface is also remarkable.",
