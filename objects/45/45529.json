  "text": "Exquisitely carved from bamboo root, this small scholar's object represents a bushy-maned Buddhist lion-dog (<I>shih-tzu</I>) with two cubs and a pierced ball. The ball symbolizes the Buddhist jewel of truth that the lion dog protects. The theme is likely taken from fine-line paintings of Buddhist divinities, which often included fantastic beasts such as these. In style and technique, this sculpture is closest to the work of Shih Ch'i-chi also called Ta-sheng. He was a second generation member of a well-known family of bamboo carvers in Chia-ting, Kiangsu province, the great bamboo carving center that produced a majority of the finest carvers.",
