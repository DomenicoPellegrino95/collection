  "text": "Reflecting the scholarly taste for antiquity, this gilded bronze censer is made in vague imitation of a bronze age ritual vessel called <I>kuei<I>. It is cast and carved in relief displaying a wave pattern with dragons, phoenix, and other mythological animals all accented in gilt.\r\n<P>The center of the base is inset with a large, rectangular cartouche containing a six-character seal-script mark which reads, \"made by Chu chen-ming of Yun-chien, Sung-chiang Kiangsu.\" Very few bronzes with Chu's mark have survived. He evidently worked in Hu-Wen-ming's (1573-1620) workshop where he completely assimilated the master's style and then became an independent artisan producing bronze objects in scholar's taste.",
