  "text": "Miners were a favorite subject for Francisco Mora. Born just a generation after Mexico's revered muralist triumvirate (Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros), Mora also believed art could have social importance. He paid tribute to his country's working poor, sketching their angular figures and weary faces with disarming directness. For 56 years he was married to American artist Elizabeth Catlett (1915-2012), whom he met at the Taller de Gr√°fica Popular (People's Graphics Workshop) in Mexico City. ",
