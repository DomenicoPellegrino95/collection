  "description": "This Kia is a massive type that apprears to have been peculiar to the Yin-Early Chou Period.  It is a rather clumsy form of which no later examples are known.  The legs support the bowl over a fire; the side handle was used for pouring.\r\n\r\nThe modern example, with the lower section of a li-ting, bird uprights, and a handle topped with a bovine mask with horns in relief on both the front and back surfaces, has been attributed to the Shanghai area.\r\n",
