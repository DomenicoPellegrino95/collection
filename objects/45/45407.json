  "text": "Born near Yang-chou into an artisan family, Ts'ai Chia's early training was as a silversmith, but he was friendly with several leading artistic and cultured figures and he gradually evolved into a skilled painter, poet, and calligrapher. He saw himself as part of the Ch'ing orthodox lineage and was strongly influenced by Wang Hui (1632-1717), Wang Shih-min (1592-1680), and others of this important group.\r\n<P>Ts'ai often painted with color in a controlled manner and precise brushwork that generally reflected the conservative orthodox tradition. He was also, however, a lyrical poetic painter of romantic images as this large, ink landscape demonstrates. When Ts'ai breaks from the orthodox formulas of ink drawing followed by color application as he does \r\n<P>While the painting is an original concept of the artist, his inscription is found on an earlier painting by the famous Wu school artist, Wen Cheng-ming (1470-1559). The odd alignment of the inscription is seen in one of the few other landscapes by Ts'ai-Chia done in this style.",
