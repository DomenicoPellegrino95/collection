  "text": "Beauty through simple materials was a hallmark of the Stickley style. Here, carefully chosen pieces of oak display unique wood grain. Metal and wood inlays provide a surprising pop of interest on the small folding doors in front and along the sides of the legs. Other fine details include the overhangs on the writing surface, referencing architecture, and the numerous drawers and doors for tidily storing pens, paper, stamps, and other writing supplies.",
