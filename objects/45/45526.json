  "text": "Anhui and Shexian, in particular, had been the center of the ink-making industry since Tang times (618-906). The son of a prosperous Anhui merchant, Cheng Dayue immersed himself in the design and production of ink cakes from an early age. Genuine ink cakes by Cheng are extremely rare and signed lacquer presentation boxes by him are almost unheard of. Decorated on the exterior with a boating scene, this circular box would have originally held a round commemorative ink cake. Inside the cover and on the base are three gold lacquer seals of the workshop of Cheng Junfang, a well-known art name of Cheng Dayue. They read, \"Made under the supervision of Junfang from Yanzhen in old She (Huizhou).\"",
