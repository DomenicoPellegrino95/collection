  "text": "The moment American dancer Loïe Fuller glided onto the Folies-Bergère stage in Paris in 1892, Art Nouveau had its goddess. Pierre Roche was one of many artists enraptured by her billowing veils and draperies. To illustrate French critic Roger Marx's essay on Fuller, Roche used his experimental technique of gypsography, in which he made a plaster mold of his design, painted the mold's interior, then pressed wet Japan paper inside to create \"sculpted prints.\" These reliefs were so time-consuming and fragile that they were confined to being an Art Nouveau oddity.",
