  "text": "Pien Shou-min was born in Huai-an, Kiangsu province where he was trained early in calligraphy and poetry. He passed the first level exams, but seems not to have entered government service and, from the 1720's onward, spent enough time painting in Yangchou to be included by some critics amongst the group known as the \"Eight Eccentrics of Yangchou.\" While Pien became famous for his relatively naturalistic and formulaic paintings of geese, he had a definite literary side, and in this unusual album, he has meticulously rendered with a dry brush, several inkstones that were in his possesion at one time or another. Later owners of the album have added commentaries making the work an interesting and informative literati document concerning old inkstones.",
