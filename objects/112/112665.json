  "text": "In the portrait tradition of August Sander's Circus Artists, Cologne, 1926 (in the MIA's collection), Xavier Tavera captures the wonder and fantasy of the circus through this otherworldly body builder. The rotund figure is clad in leopard-patterned tights and proudly holds two bright red bowling balls against a\r\nburgundy stage curtain. His face is covered with a layer of oddly placed adhesive bandages.\r\nThe photograph is part of his series \"El Circo\" (The Circus), in which subjects perform odd circus acts as an homage of the Latino community's traditional appreciation for circus and street performers. These characters, played by the artist's friends, pose for a large-format camera in front of colorful sets the artist constructed and painted to complement the figures. Tavera's portraits highlight the individuals within a circus. What roles are portrayed by both real and pretend circus performers'\r\n",
