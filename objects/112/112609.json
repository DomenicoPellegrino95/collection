  "text": "Following his apprenticeship in the studio of Isidore Pils at the École des Beaux-Arts, painter/printmaker Norbert Goeneutte joined the community of progressive artists in Montmartre. There he modeled for Renoir and was closely associated with Manet and Degas. He spent the last three years of his life in Auvers-sur-Oise, where he worked closely with Dr. Paul Gachet, promoting contemporary art and literature.\r\n \r\nFor the present drawing, Goeneutte applied the conté crayon with force, producing deep, rich tones. The image's eccentric, stylized proportions required that Goeneutte join two sheets of paper together. The elongated image recalls some of Whistler's painted portraits or the Symbolist work of Fernand Khnopff. The drawing is among the most direct, monumental, and appealing images that Goeneutte produced. In the year of his death, it served as the basis for a lithograph published in L'Estampe originale.",
