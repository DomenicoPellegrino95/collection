  "text": "Model clubs were produced by many tribes across the northern Plains, where they were used during victory dances or celebrations. Although model clubs were similar to those used in combat, they were meant for show. In this example produced by an unknown male Lakota artist; an image of the enemy has been carved at one end. Based on the delicately carved features, Pompadour-style hair, upper portion of the face painted red, and with a single braid on the back, the carved image probably represents an Apsaalooka (Crow) man. During the 19th century, many battles occurred between the Lakota and the Apsaalooka, and this club may represent a victory by the original owner.",
