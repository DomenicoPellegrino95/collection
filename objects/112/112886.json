  "text": "The American Impressionist Childe Hassam was a stout and sturdy New Englanderâ€”his family tree included the novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne, and his surname was derived from the English name Horsham. He also liked nature, and was furious when a frenzy of new construction blotted out the green space around his New York studio. After settling into a new studio, Hassam produced this emphatically green park, which nearly obliterates the skyscrapers faintly sketched at upper right. ",
