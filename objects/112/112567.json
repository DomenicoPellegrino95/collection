  "text": "Kevin Pourier is the most well-known Native American artist working with buffalo horn today. Although an old Plains tradition, buffalo horn carving is almost a lost technique. Pourier has single-handedly revived this tradition, but his work reflects contemporary issues and his own personal perspective. On this example, Pourier fashioned a traditional ladle form, but embellished it with commentary that addresses contemporary Native American identity. He rendered his own portrait on the underside of the ladle, wearing his trademark sunglasses and a hat. A wing of a butterfly can be seen in the band of his hat, and acts as his personal glyph; another butterfly flutters above him. On each side of his portrait, hands in two different colors point at him. The red shaded hands represent fellow Native Americans from his community and the white colored hands represent Euro-Americans. As a \"Mixed Blood Guy,\" being part Native American and part Euro-American, Pourier illustrates in this work that he is often stuck in the middle between these two communities, with each side unwilling to accept him completely.",
