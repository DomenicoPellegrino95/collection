  "text": "Bill Kelly is a noted contemporary American painter, printmaker, sculptor, and co-director of San Diego's Brighton Press, a nationally known fine book press and publisher. Founded by Kelly in 1985, Brighton Press is recognized for its high quality productions of limited edition books featuring original graphics and fine letterpress printing. \t\t\t\r\n     Kelly's graphic work is generally abstract, with a strong lyricism that is inspired by nature and natural forms. For the Traces project, he produced a series of brilliant double-page intaglio prints with overlays of hand-applied pochoir (stencils).  A rich blend of texture, color, and tone dominates the page and engulfs the reader's field of vision. The book also features an equal number of Peter Everwine's evocative prose poems, brief narratives of personal loss and remembrance set as letterpress and printed directly on Kelly's images.\r\n      Kelly currently teaches drawing and printmaking at the University of San Diego, as well as letterpress printing at San Diego State University. A forthcoming solo exhibition at the Fresno Art Museum will focus on his long-standing collaboration with Everwine, an award-winning writer, poet, translator, and retired professor of poetry currently living in Fresno, California.\r\n",
