  "text": "Jaune Quick-To-See Smith is an acclaimed contemporary Native American painter and printmaker, as well as a leading social activist. Her work centers on themes found in the Native American world, such as assimilation, Native American traditions, and interactions and conflict between Native Americans and Euro-Americans.  \r\n\r\nThis lithograph, inspired by anatomical charts, features a stylized image of a human torso that has identifier lines that lead to images (rather than anatomical terms). Some of the images relate to traditional Native American culture others reference the natural world. Others suggest the impact of Euro-American culture (barcode and bicycle). While Quick-to-See Smith surely intends the work as a commentary on the potentially destructive nature of the Euro-American traditions on Native peoples (a target is placed over the heart), she also suggests that, for better or worse, we are all comprised of a mixture of traditions.\r\n",
