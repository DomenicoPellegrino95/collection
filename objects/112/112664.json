  "text": "Interested in the intrigue and entertainment of the circus spectacle, Xavier Tavera created his \"El Circo\" series of portraits by constructing sets and posing his friends as characters. Tavera's tattooed lady blends into her composed environment, a chameleon seeking to be seen. As she stands slightly bent, captured in the light, she might be stepping out into the world or about to recede into her background. Tavera's characters may come across as outcasts, insiders, or both. Half a world and eighty years apart, Tavera's created characters converse with August Sander's documented circus artists.",
