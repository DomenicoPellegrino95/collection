  "text": "Yoshitomo Nara's sculpture Your Dog embodies the spirit of a child's playmate as well as that of a menacing creature, larger than life. Its huge scale reminds viewers how the world looks through the eyes of a child. Nara's work has attracted large audiences around the world, from fine-art collectors to commercial consumers, as it is shown in museums and galleries as well as sold in the forms of T-shirts, children's books, and other commercial goods.",
