  "text": "Klee's playful depiction of a solitary dog baying at a radiant moon exemplifies the artist's reliance on a linear style of representation.  Using a series of sinuous lines, Klee creates a harmonious arrangement of three distinct forms:  a dog, the moon, and in an unusual but charming visualization of sound, the dog's extended howl. Placed at the center of an amorphous ground of swirling colors, the dog's howl assumes a dominant pictorial role, winding, bending on itself, hanging in the night air like a wisp of smoke, while representing  a visual as well as temporal record of the emanating sound.  Klee's two-dimensional composition effectively supplants traditional spatial illusion, revealing a simple, yet elegant ideogram for the painting's whimsical subject.",

  "provenance": "Alfred Flechtheim [1878-1937] until 1929; [1] Dr. Alfred L. Tietz [1883-1941], Cologne, Germany, and his descendants from 1929-1948; [2] (Thannhauser Gallery, New York City, New York, in 1948). [3] J. B. Neumann, New York City, New York, probably in 1948; [4] F. C. Schang, New York City, New York, probably by 1948/49 through 1956; gift to MIA in 1956. [5]\r\n\r\n[1] and [2] Letter in curatoral file dated July 20, 2000 from Albert Tietz, the son of Dr. Alfred Tietz states that Dr. Tietz acquired the painting from Alfred Flechtheim - a friend of his father. The family removed their art collection with them to Holland in 1933 and in 1939 (\"probably in September after the beginning of World War II, but prior to the May 10, 1940 Nazi invasion of Holland\") shipped part of the collection (including 'Heulender Hund') with their neighbors who were emigrating to the U.S. The works were stored at the Manhattan Storage Warehouse in  New York City until 1948 when Mrs. Tietz and her son arrived from Jerusalem, Israel (where they had emigrated in two months before the invasion of Holland by the Nazis in May of 1940). Files on Tietz found in the Paul Klee Archives in Bern, Switzerland state that Tietz purchased three works by Klee from Flechtheim in 1929.\r\n\r\n[3] The above-referenced letter from the son of Dr. Tietz states that his mother placed the Klee, and other works, with Kaethe and Justin Thannhauser, who subsequently paid her, Margaret C. Tietz for the sale of the Klee.\r\n\r\n[4] A label in the conservation file originally removed from the verso of the painting states that the work came from the collection of F. C. Schang. The label (partially destroyed on the upper left to center) lists  \"...ll. Tietz, Cologne\" and \"J. B. Neumann\" as former collections.\r\n\r\n[5]Acquired by gift from F. C. Schang on December 31, 1956. Received at the MIA on January 21, 1957 and logged in as \"L[oan] 57.18\" until it was formally approved for accession on January 24, 1957 by the Accessions Committee. This explains the presence of the MIA label on vers",
