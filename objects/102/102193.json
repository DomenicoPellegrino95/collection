  "text": "Large covered jars such as this have been found in tombs where they probably functioned as storage jars for food for the afterlife. Vietnamese potters developed a unique technique for decorating these types of jars. After a cream-colored ash glaze was applied to the body and allowed to dry, a design was engraved into it. The carved areas were then painted with an iron-oxide glaze, the dark brown of which was neatly contained within the incised lines. A frieze of lotus petals in high relief often decorated the shoulders of these vessels. The lotus is an iconic Buddhist symbol for spiritual purity. A great deal of Buddhist imagery appear on Ly and Tran dynasty ceramics made for use on domestic altars, monasteries, and pagodas as well as tombs.",
