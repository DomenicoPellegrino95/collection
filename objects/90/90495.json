  "text": "This side chair is one of a pair that was recently donated by a Rochester, Minnesota family that acquired it in Kennebunk, Maine in the early 20th century.  It bears a striking resemblance to the adjacent side chair once owned by pre-revolutionary military hero Sir William Pepperrell of Maine.  Nearly identical, these chairs appear to have been made with the same pattern and may have originated in the very same shop of Thomas Baxter.  Marks on their inner seat rails reveal, however, that they were both chair \"II\" of their respective sets, and hence, were made for different clients.",
