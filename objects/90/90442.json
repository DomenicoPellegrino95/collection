Known as <I>neriage<I> or <I>nerikomi<I> in Japanese, this technique has been revived by Japanese contemporary potters. Self-taught potter Ogata Kamio_ lives in Shinshinotsu Village on Japan's northernmost island, Hokkaido_. His contribution to the <I>neriage<I> technique is to combine shades of clay in such a way as to create the visual perception of movement.",
