  "text": "Apsaalooka beadwork consists of two extremes: highly or minimally decorated items. Most beaded objects are highly decorated with fields of color over their entire surface.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Apsaalooka are also masters of creating elegant, minimally decorated items. The multi-colored beaded bars on these bags give the illusion of an entirely beaded surface. The repeated vertical and horizontal patterns create well-balanced and symmetrical surfaces.",
