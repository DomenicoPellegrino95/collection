  "text": "Nineteenth century American farmers developed an astonishing variety of poultry crossbreeds - highly specific kinds of birds raised for meat, eggs, or even appearance.  Weathervane makers catered to this popularity by developing breed specific vanes such as this Hamburg Rooster.  This rooster's magnificently swept back comb and tail would have given the illusion of a brisk wind, even on a still day.",
