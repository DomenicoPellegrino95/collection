  "text": "Jonathan Howard & Company was one of the earliest weathervane manufacturers in America.  The factory made some of the most detailed weathervanes of the day by using hand-carved wooden molds and casting the entire front of each piece in zinc, rather than just the head as most makers did.  Originally gilded, long exposure to the elements has weathered this piece to expose both of the underlying metals. The highly stylized crimped tail gives the viewer the impression of feathers rippling in the wind.  ",
