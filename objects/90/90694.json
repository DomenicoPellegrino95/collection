  "text": "Intended for incense burning, probably at a Buddhist altar, this deep basin is raised on five cabriole legs. Its high domed cover of stepped form is pierced with regularly spaced clusters of small holes grouped in threes and fives, interspersed with comma-shaped cloud motifs in the concave outer border. The dome is pierced with petal shaped panels comprised of multiple scroll form openings. The knob takes the form of a lotus bud, the flower symbolic of Buddhism. This vessel is quite rare and its form is unique to the T'ang dynasty (618-906). Of the few bronze censers with pierced lids like this one that are known, this is one of the largest. It was most likely used at a domestic Buddhist alter and buried with its owner for use in the afterlife.",
