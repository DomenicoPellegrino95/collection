  "text": "In the fall of 1879, Whistler was commissioned by the Fine Art Society of London to travel to Venice for two months to make twelve etchings. However, he was so inspired by the city that he stayed for more than a year, during which he created 50 etchings, nearly 100 pastels, and numerous paintings. The Palaces, Whistler's largest etching, presents a view along the Grand Canal featuring the Palazzo Sagredo and the Palazzo Pesaro, two of the city's lesser-known architectural gems.",
