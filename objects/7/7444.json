  "text": "Albrecht Dürer's unique influence on art of the Veneto is easily seen in these two prints. Giulio Campagnola copied the landscape with a tall, waterside house from Du¨rer's earlier engraving. Campagnola was recorded as working in Venice in 1507, around the time of Dürer's second visit (1506-7). Whether the two artists met remains unknown.",
