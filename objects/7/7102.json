  "text": "The best of the Art Deco silversmiths favored originality over longstanding tradition, but it was Puiforcat who must be considered the greatest innovator. He produced some of the most stunning silverwork of the 20th century, among them the three works installed in this case: a cocktail shaker, teapot and tea service, the latter having become one of the revered icons of modernity. He was a perfectionist successfully proving that traditional embellishments, such as chasing and repoussé, could be eliminated without sacrificing luxury.",
