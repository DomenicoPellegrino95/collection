  "text": "The figures of Adam and Eve represent the perfection of God's first creatures. Dürer's effort to endow them with perfect bodies led him to measure and analyze many ordinary mortals. Dürer wrote: \"If you wish to make a beautiful human figure, it is necessary that you probe the nature and proportions of many people: a head from one; a breast, arm, leg from another…\" His systems were mathematical: he measured body parts to calculate the ratio between them and the height of the person. For example, he found that a beautiful man would be six times as tall as his head. Dürer's manuscripts were not published within his lifetime, but they set a trend imitated throughout the 16th century. (see also Lautensack's book in this section) ",
