  "text": "Prints made after Titian's compositions were popular. The Assumption of the Virgin by Domenico Campagnola is similar to an altarpiece by Titian at the basilica of Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari in Venice. Campagnola's engraving was printed the year before Titian finished his painting, suggesting that Campagnola had access to Titian's workshop.\r\n\r\nThe words \"Titianvs Inv,\" in the lower-right corner of Nicolò Boldrini's Venus and Cupid woodcut, attributes the design to Titian. However, by 1566 Titian was no longer creating woodcuts. More likely, Boldrini incorporated an earlier figural group by Titian with his own landscape design to create a desirable product in the Venetian mode.\r\n",
