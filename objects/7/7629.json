  "text": "Grooms' audacious portrait of the Surrealist artist-provocateur Salvador Dali emerging from a bowl of salad greens satirizes the traditional notions of portraiture, dream imagery, and indeed, Dali himself, whose disembodied head is served up on a platter. For this remarkably complex project, Grooms used fresh vegetables he purchased at a Minneapolis supermarket as the models for his salad ingredients, which were recreated as screenprints on vinyl. Painted ping pong balls were used for Dali's intense gaze.  ",
