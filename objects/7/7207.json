  "text": "This story hammers home the idea of women's fatal power with fierce clarity. Jael was alone when the warrior Sisera, weary from battling the Israelites, stopped by for something to drink (at top). When he fell asleep, Jael most inhospitably pounded a tent peg through his skull. Although she may have hoped her treachery would endear her to the Israelites, who later came looking for Sisera (at right), Lucas van Leyden was more interested in portraying the lethal consequences of trusting a woman.",
