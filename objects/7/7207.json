  "text": "Sisera was a Canaanite general whose army was routed and slaughtered by the Israelites. After the battle, Sisera sought refuge in the tent of Jael, whose husband's tribe was at peace with the Canaanite. Jael welcomed him, covered him with a rug and offered him milk. While Sisera slept, Jael drove a tent peg through his head and presented the dead general to the Israelite who had come in search of their enemy. Lucas simultaneously represents Jael presenting Sisera with a goblet of milk, slaying him and presenting his corpse to the Israelites. The artist protrayed Jael in the context of the power of woman as a treacherous seductress who violates the laws of hospitality and her husband's friendship with Sisera.",
