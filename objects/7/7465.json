  "text": "As one of his twelve labors, Hercules had to capture the cattle of the monstrous Geryon. He succeeded, only to have Cacus, a fire-breathing monster, steal some of the cattle, hide them in his cave, and then block the entrance with a boulder. Hercules used his great strength to break into the cave and beat the thief to death. The Master of Year 1515 takes a ribald approach to Cacus's misery, sandwiching him between Hercules and the horse so Cacus is scarcely discernible. The most prominent feature of the entire print may be the horse's rump. ",
