  "text": "Whistler liked to fuss with his printing plates. At least six years and ten stages of alteration came between the present impression and the early proof shown nearby. Perhaps it was his now distant memory of Venice that caused him to mute the light in the present impression. He achieved this softer effect by using a chocolaty brown ink on a copper plate whose drypoint lines had become somewhat worn and by printing on warm-toned Asian paper.",
