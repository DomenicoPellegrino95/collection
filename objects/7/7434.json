  "text": "One of the earliest efforts to illustrate a printed book with engraved printing plates occurred in 1481 as part of a patriotic effort to assert Dante's Florentine origin. The plan was to produce an edition of the Divine Comedy with one hundred engraved plates-one for each canto-designed by Sandro Botticelli, one of the city's greatest artists. Unfortunately, the project was a complete fiasco. Since engraved plates require a different type of printing press than letterpress text, spaces had to be left for the plates. This extra coordination proved too much for the printer. He forgot to leave room for the first plate, and after the second plate, he gave up on printing the engraving on the same sheets as the text. Instead the individual engravings were pasted onto blank spaces left in the text. In the end only nineteen plates were produced and the other eighty-one illustrations fell by the wayside.\r\n\r\nThis engraving, in which Dante and Virgil see a vision of Dante's beloved Beatrice before they reach the entrance to Hell, illustrated the second canto. A number of extra impressions were pulled, for it was sometimes pasted in before the third canto and is today the most frequently encountered of the plates.\r\n",
