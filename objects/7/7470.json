  "text": "Painter Antonio Pollaiuolo left behind just one print, and it revolutionized engraving in Italy. Battle of the Nudes is the earliest known Italian engraving to bear the artist's full signature, visible on the plaque at left, and one of the first to display nudes. It is also easily twice the size of other fifteenth-century engravings. Rather than tying his savage theme to a specific literary source, as was common in his day, the artist invites us to develop our own interpretation. The print is undoubtedly a demonstration piece-that is, a work designed to showcase Pollaiuolo's skill at depicting facial expressions and male anatomy. Notice that several pairs of battlers show the same pose from the front and back.\r\n",
