  "text": "When Raphael wanted to circulate his famous paintings and sketches to a wider audience across Europe, he turned to Marcantonio Raimondi to engrave his work. Marcantonio devised an ingenious system of lines and cross-hatching that captured the essence of Raphael's designs without calling attention to the technique. Generations of printmakers would pick up on Marcantonio's invention, changing the medium forever. This impression is distinguished by the gray ink wash that was added at some point in its history, particularly apparent in the arched fragment above the Holy Family. The ruins are no doubt largely Marcantonio's own invention and not in Raphael's original sketch.",
