  "text": "Thomas Sully’s portrait of America’s revolutionary hero and first president borrows heavily from the conventions of European royal portraiture. Charles-Clément Bervic’s glittering depiction of Louis XVI—conceived to glorify the monarch’s omnipotent authority and wealth—embodies this type. Sully sought to attach similar iconography to our founding father.\r\n \r\nEach leader is set amid majestic columns and billowing drapery and assumes an elegant dance-like pose and an impenetrable gaze. Roughly contemporaries, Washington and Louis XVI also wear similar hair-styles, knickers, and shoes, and display tricorn hats and swords at their hips, a symbol of their military might. Also, both portraits incorporate fasces, bundles of wooden rods signifying unity and justice. In the French portrait these sit above the oval relief depicting Justice, and in the American painting, they appear as the table leg.\r\n \r\nThere are important differences between the portraits, to be sure. Far from Louis’s royal ermine cloak embroidered with fleurs-de-lys, Washington wears sober black, and there are no diamonds on his shoe buckles. Instead of holding a scepter and pointing to a crown and a hand of justice, the president steadies his hand on a desk strewn with papers and books—symbols of a rule founded in enlightened principles and just laws. Washington is also shown not raised on a dais but directly on the floor. Despite the aloof power Louis XVI exudes in Bervic’s print, he would be arrested and beheaded shortly after it was published.
