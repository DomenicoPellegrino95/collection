  "text": "During the 1830s, Catlin journeyed the Great Plains to record the appearance and customs of native people through painting. As he traveled, he became acutely aware that the growing demand for fashionable robes made from the fur of American bison (or buffalo) threatened the species with extinction. Worried about the impact of America's westward expansion on Native American civilization, wildlife, and wilderness, Catlin proposed that these treasures be protected by the government in \"a nation's park, containing man and beast, in all the wild and freshness of their nature's beauty!\"",
