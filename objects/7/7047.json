  "text": "A gift from his teacher Warren MacKenzie, this bowl by the Japanese master potter Shoji Hamada has presented many questions to Mark Pharis. Pharis spent years examining the form and decoration and appreciates Hamada's way with clay and his use of different textures and slip overlays. Pharis, however, is unsatisfied with the transition from the decorated exterior of the pot and the undecorated interior and he chose this bowl for inclusion in this display primarily for its emotional link with his most important teacher Warren MacKenzie.",
