The King's treacherous minister Haman, assuming that he was to be rewarded, proposed that the honoree should be clad in royal apparel and allowed to parade with princes and nobels.  While Mordecai rides in triumph in the foreground, Haman is executed on a gallows in the background in retribution for his plot to massacre the Jewish population.",
