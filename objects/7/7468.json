  "text": "Woodcuts had a far richer tradition among Germans than among Italians, making Master I.B. with the Bird-note the tiny bird next to his monogram-a rarity. Of his eleven woodcuts, Saint Jerome and the Lion is the finest. The image of the ascetic saint removing a thorn from a lion's paw, which represents compassion subduing brute strength, was a bit outdated when the master created his intricate woodcut. More in vogue was Albrecht DÃ¼rer's scholarly portrayal of the saint, also included in this exhibition. Both prints include Saint Jerome's traditional iconography of skull, signifying life's transience; book, showing his scholarly nature; and cardinal's hat and crucifix, showing his devotion.",
