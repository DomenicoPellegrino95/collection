  "text": "The theme of this print is the Immaculate Conception, the idea that Mary was born free of original sin. Although popularized in the Golden Legend around 1260, the doctrine was controversial by the early sixteenth century. To rally believers, Master NAoDAT undertook this ambitious engraving. On either side of the central tableau, angels bring messages to Mary's father, Joachim, and her husband, Joseph: Joachim at left gets news of Mary's birth, and Joseph hears that Mary will bear Jesus. The large inscription reads, \"Grace to her from whom this immaculate ground was taken, from whom the truth has grown.\" This monogrammist acquired his name from the initials and tiny mousetrap in the lower right corner of the print.",
