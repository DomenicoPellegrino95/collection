Centaurs battle on his shoulders and their sea-faring cousins, hippocampi, on his chest. Naked women with garlands and cornucopias represent the abundance that his military strength will yield. On his thighs Hercules performs heroic deeds. His poleyns (knee covers) are expected to come back into fashion any day now.",
