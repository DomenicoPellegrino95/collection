Here the unsettled and notoriously moody duke wears armor ornamented with symbols of the dynasty, certainly intended as a reminder of his strength and lineage. The beribboned diamond ring in the upper right corner was a Medicean emblem whose hardness connoted the durability of the family's reign, which lasted from the thirteenth to the seventeenth century.",
