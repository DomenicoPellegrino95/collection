  "text": "In 1981, Chuck Close worked with Minneapolis-based master printer Steven Andersen to produce a large lithographic portrait of Philip Glass. The ever-inventive Close chose to make the image using fingerprints applied to the thin aluminum plate. He touched an ink pad with his finger tip before each touch of the plate. The accumulated fingerprints resolve into an iconic image that Close also executed in other media.\r\n \r\nUnfortunately for Close, the image became too dense for satisfactory printing. Andersen had to urge him to repeat the exercise, this time with the artist cleaning his fingertip after each touch of the plate. Here we show the lithographic plate from the first attempt along with an impression of the print that resulted from the second attempt.\r\n \r\nAndersen recently sold the plate to the MIA for a modest sum to ensure that it would join the museum’s extensive archive of Vermillion Editions Limited, his printing and publishing enterprise.",
