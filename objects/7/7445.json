  "text": "Lucas Cranach helped launch the fashion in northern Europe for chiaroscuro woodcuts, a technique of making a print from two or more blocks-one carrying the black lines of the design and the other block or blocks carrying the color. This popular woodcut shows Saint Christopher, whose name means \"Christ bearer,\" ferrying the Christ Child across the river as the boy grows heavier and heavier. Though dated 1506 in the woodblock, this print was more likely created a few years later and backdated so that Cranach could claim that he invented this specialized printmaking technique.",
