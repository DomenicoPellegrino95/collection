  "text": "This extremely wildness of this nocturnal procession has prompted some to identify the bony beast as the Devil himself. Contemporary observers would have recognized the woman with windblown hair as a witch. Apart from general agreement that this is one of the most bizarre compositions of the Renaissance, much about it-its subject, the identity of both the designer and the engraver, as well as the date-is a matter of debate.",
