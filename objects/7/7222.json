  "text": "Although Venice originated in the early Middle Ages as a swampland stronghold against northern barbarians, the powerful republic identified itself with the ancient Romans and their sea god, Neptune. This print is one of two long, horizontal engravings that create a frieze of Neptune and his entourage. The design of the figures is likely based on grotesques unearthed from Roman ruins and circulated among artists in the early Renaissance.",
