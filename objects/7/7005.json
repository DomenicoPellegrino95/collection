  "text": "Kitao_ji Rosanjin is considered by many to be the premier Japanese potter of the twentieth century. He had already earned a reputation as a talented calligrapher when he became interested in tableware through his association with the renowned Tokyo restaurant, Hoshigaoka. He experimented widely with traditional styles, and was incredibly adept at reproducing the spirit of historic ceramics. At the same time, he was also inventive, decorating some of his works in a distinctly modern manner. Here, Rosanjin based his design on a type of ceramic originally championed by the tea master Furuta Oribe (1544-1615) which featured innovative shapes irregularly decorated by dipping a portion of the form into a glaze mixture. After firing, these brilliant, grass green areas contrasted nicely with whimsical paintings in iron brown.",
