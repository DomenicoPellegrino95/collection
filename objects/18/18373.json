  "text": " In Renaissance and Baroque symbolism, the female figure often stands for the human soul, whereas the male—especially when characterized as a hybrid half-human, half-animal, such as a Centaur or a Satyr—is allegorical of the primordial, physical forces of hunger, thirst and sexual lust. The bronze group presents the crucial moment within an open-ended narration, which urges the beholder to ponder its potential continuation and ending. Using the bronze as a conversation piece, humanist scholars would have been prompted to ponder the meaning and the conclusion of the scene.",
