  "text": "Trees bedeviled Wanda Gág. She understood their rhythms, but how to paint the air that surrounded each form' That question preoccupied her time at Tumble Timbers, as she called the New Jersey farm she rented ($8 a month) in the 1920s to escape her New York apartment. This incessantly flecked-and-dashed scene shows one solution. It was executed on Manning Speed-grits sandpaper, an inexpensive and appropriately rustic medium that Gág liked. Just a year after painting Tree Forms, she published her famous children’s book Millions of Cats.",
