  "text": "The fearsome goddess, Kali, holds the head of an annihilated demon in one of her left hands while trampling upon the god, Shiva. This image might represent theatrical performances of the same subject that still occur in Bengal. In this image, a lithograph provided the initial outlines, which are most visible on Shiva's tiger skin waistcloth, Kali's garland of human heads, and on the ground.",
