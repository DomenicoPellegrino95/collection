  "text": "An artist who was active in the organization of the very important Armory Show of 1913, Walt Kuhn continued to be an influential artist in the thirties and forties. His works exhibit a realism which had been dramatically new in the early years of the century, and which continued to be a major stylistic characteristic throughout the thirties and forties. Walt Kuhn's portrait of a clown, Sandy, incorporates the sensitive, realistic portrayal of a clown, with the bold application of strongly contrasting colors and brush strokes. The subject matter of a clown is typical of the interests of the artists who wanted to portray the different types of people as they really were, and the style is indicative of a trend toward a bolder use of color and paint than had been seen before.",
