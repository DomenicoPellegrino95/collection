  "text": "Elizabeth Godfrey originally registered her mark as Elizabeth Buteux following the death of her first husband Abraham Buteux, then again when her second husband Benjamin Godfrey died.  She enjoyed the patronage of aristocratic clients throughout her career, and is represented in the collection of several major museums.  \r\n\r\nHer training presumably began under her father, distinguished sivlersmith Simon Pantin.  Augustin Courtauld apprenticed with Pantin before establishing his own family dynasty in the trade. Note the salver in the center of this case, which was retailed by Courtauld's son and daughter-in-law.",
