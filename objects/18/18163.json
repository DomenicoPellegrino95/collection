Red is a festive and auspicious color to the Chinese. It is prominent in decorations for birthdays, anniversaries, and New Year's celebrations. Major birthdays were celebrated at the age of 60, 70, and 80 years and hangings such as this were commissioned by prominent families to honor one or more of their elders. Exceptionally large and colorful banners carrying lengthy lauditory inscriptions were focal points of important family celebrations.",
