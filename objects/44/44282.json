  "text": "“Mexico is a country of tragic happiness. There is an ironic side to Mexicans, humor and rage together; we laugh at death.” -Rufino Tamayo \r\nDeath is front and center in this lithograph and in the Mexican psyche. Mexican by birth, Rufino Tamayo made a concerted effort to move past the nationalist themes favored by the generation of Mexican artists that preceded him and toward more universal ones. While working in France in 1959, he produced a series of lithographs illustrating the chapters of the New Testament book of Revelation. Included in the series were images of the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse: Conquest, War, Famine and Death. In this print, Tamayo depicts Death, the last of the Four Horsemen.",
