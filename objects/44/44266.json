  "text": "The gift of this important pair of Mannerist prints is just one example of the Jones family's continued support of the Institute's Department of Prints and Drawings. Herschel's son Carl Waring Jones (1887-1957) was instrumental in revitalizing the department in the 1950s and funded an educational program dedicated to prints. Carl's children-Winton Jones (1924-2003), Waring Jones (b. 1927), and Thirza Jones Cleveland (1929-97)-later contributed to the renovation of the print gallery and study room named in honor of their grandfather. Winton inherited his grandfather's passion for collecting, and his family recently designated Gallery 344 in his name and endowed a fund so the museum could continue to add significant works on paper to the collection.",
