  "description": "The form and decoration of this vessel are of the type ordinarily referred , somewhat vaguely, to the Chou Dynasty.  Like others in this group , it is an obvious imitation and is the kind of thing made during the late twenties and early thirties in the Shanghai region.  It is also in Shanghai that such vessels were usually offered for sale.\r\n\r\nA comparison of this vessel with the Yin-Early Chou example (50.46.116a,b) in the collection will be illuminating.",
