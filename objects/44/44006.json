  "text": "Racz joined the wave of European artists who immigrated to America after the outbreak of war in 1939. A painter, sculptor, printmaker, and educator, he was active at Atelier 17 in New York between 1943 and 1945. Among the prints he produced there is this dramatic interpretation of the mythic Greek hero-warrior Perseus, who victoriously holds the severed head of the slain Gorgon monster Medusa. Racz produced this print at a time when Hayter and other artists working at Atelier 17 were actively experimenting in color printing techniques. Racz's composition was strongly influenced both by Hayter's distinct brand of abstract surrealism and Picasso's anguished and tormented images of mythical subjects.  ",
