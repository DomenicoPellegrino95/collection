  "text": "This satire parallels an account of the Florentine power broker Cosimo de' Medici's (1389-1464) advice to a husband worried by rumors of his wife's infidelity: \"As to the horn which seems to you to be growing on your head, you had better swallow it, and then take a walk by the town wall. Then halt by the first ditch you come to, and having brought up the horn, throw it into the ditch and bury it so that no one may see it.\" In the print, supplicants come before the goat king to have their horns removed. One of the inscriptions notes the inevitability of the husband's sinking feeling: \"he who is not a goat will become one.\"",
