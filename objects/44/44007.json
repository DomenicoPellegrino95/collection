  "text": "Walking as a metaphor for spiritual fulfillment is the subject of Just a Closer Walk with Thee, a rare linoleum cut by renowned African-American artist Charles W. White. The print borrows its title from the traditional gospel song of the same name, a song thought to have originated from southern African-American churches of the second half of the nineteenth century. In more recent years, the song has become something of a fixture of popular music, especially among jazz musicians. White’s powerful image of a black woman gazing toward heaven, arms outstretched, beseeching Jesus to grant her humble plea to walk beside Him, functions as the visual counterpart to the song’s prayerful lyrics. Though symbolic, the spiritual action of walking with Jesus provides believers with a personally sustaining means to express their faith and devotion. \r\nJust a closer walk with Thee,\r\nGrant it, Jesus, is my plea,\r\nDaily walking close to Thee,\r\nLet it be, dear Lord, let it be.\r\nI am weak, but Thou art strong,\r\nJesus, keep me from all wrong,\r\nI’ll be satisfied as long\r\nAs I walk, let me walk close to Thee.\r\nThrough this world of toil and snares,\r\nIf I falter, Lord, who cares'\r\nWho with me my burden shares'\r\nNone but Thee, dear Lord, none but Thee.\r\nWhen my feeble life is o’er,\r\nTime for me will be no more,\r\nGuide me gently, safely o’er\r\nTo Thy kingdom's shore, to Thy shore.",
