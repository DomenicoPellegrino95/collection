  "text": "Japanese monks traveling to China found the naturalism of leaf-decorated teabowls especially to their liking and brought back a number of them when they returned home. The effect was produced by affixing a leaf with high silica content to the interior of the bowl before immersing it in iron-rich slurry used to create the dark brown glaze. In the heat of the kiln, the silica remains after the organic material of the leaf burns away, creating the ghost-like image of the leaf.",
