  "text": "Virgil's great learning made him an ideal foil as a lovesick buffoon. In this tale, the poet falls for Emperor Augustus's daughter, who pretends to return his love and arranges for a midnight tryst in the tower. She hoists Virgil in a basket, but leaves him dangling halfway up-an actual form of public ridicule starting in the 13th century. The right half of the print depicts Virgil's revenge. He uses black magic to cast Rome in darkness, a spell that can be lifted only when townfolk touch the vixen daughter with their torches. ",
