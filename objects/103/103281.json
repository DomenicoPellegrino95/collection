  "text": "The French artist Charles Milcendeau traveled frequently to Spain, fascinated by the culture, art, and people there. He executed this forceful drawing during one of his first trips to the country, sometime in 1901. In the work, the artist presents a vivid portrait of an elderly Spanish woman. Her body, shown draped in a jet-black, coarse blanket, dominates the composition, standing boldly out against the unfinished background and tan paper support. Milcendeau focused on his subject's face, sensitively capturing the woman's rough-hewn, tired features that document the hard life she has lived.  ",
