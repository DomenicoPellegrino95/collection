  "text": "Charles Milcendeau was drawn to the people and terrain of the Vendée region of France, where he grew up and where he often traveled while living in Paris. Old Spanish Woman, however, dates from the transformative year he spent in Spain, where he felt he had discovered his roots. In the hillside town of Ledesma, he made a number of drawings of elderly women.\r\n\r\nThe impoverished subject of this forceful study is an image of enduring strength. She is proud, not pitiable. Focusing on her face, Milcendeau captured in hyperrealist style the tired, rough-hewn features and psychological numbness that testify to her hard life. Her imposing size dominates the composition. Discarding an earlier thought to give her a patterned scarf or collar—barely visible in the traces of graphite underdrawing around her shoulders—he depicted her in a severe, striking, jet-black blanket, roughly drawn, which stands out starkly against the background.",
