  "text": "This rare handscroll of military exercises is preceded by a long inscription with an official seal in both Chinese and Manchu script. It was painted for the commander of the Hu-kuang army by an anonymous eighteenth century artist. The illustrations based on Taoist cosmological foundations incorporating the \"Eight Trigrams\", were supposedly formulated by Chu-ko Liang (181-234) a brilliant military strategist as well as the hero of the popular historical novel <I>Romance of the Three Kingdoms<I> (14th c). He is said to have laid out the schemes by using rocks in a section of the Yangtze River at Yu-fu in Sichuan. The present text is a fairly accurate description of actual military drills based on the Eight Formations brought up to date by an 18th century artist. Cannon are referred to, for example, but the exercises aim to recapture the ideas of Chu-ko Liang with their Taoist underpinnings.",
