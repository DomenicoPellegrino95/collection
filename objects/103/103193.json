  "text": "One of Gabriel Weisberg's first scholarly publications was dedicated to the art of François Bonvin and the origins of the French realist movement. During a research trip in the summer of 1970, the Weisbergs purchased this chalk study, their first 19th-century drawing, from Hazlitt Gallery in London. With the acquisition of The Old Beggar, they started developing a collection that mirrored their art historical interests and also gave them the pleasure of living surrounded by the works of artists they loved. Bonvin's drawing assumed a talismanic importance in their collection because of its link to their academic pursuits and its compelling portrayal of those less fortunate in life.",
