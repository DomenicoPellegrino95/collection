  "text": "Jules Adler was a prolific painter of social-realist themes who was moved by the scenes of poverty and destitution he witnessed in the streets of Paris and the surrounding countryside. Wandering Tramp in a Field drew public attention to the presence of the indigent in the countryside. Beggars were visible not only in large cities but also, to a lesser extent, in rural areas, where they helped on farms or relied on the kindness of villagers and farmers to subsist.\r\n",
