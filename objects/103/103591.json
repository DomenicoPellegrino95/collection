  "text": "The Mangal are a nomadic group inhabiting border areas in the east Afghanistan/west Pakistan region. Although their embroidery reveals the influence of other communities in both countries, this veil, with its high degree of abstraction, appears to be uniquely Mangal.  \"Wrong-sided\" stitching along one edge shows where the veil was folded back to frame the wearer's face with an embroidered border of triangular design.",
