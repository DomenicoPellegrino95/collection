  "text": "Charles Milcendeau's travels frequently took him to districts of France that remained untouched by industrialization and to sites where centuries-old traditions were still deeply ingrained in daily life. One such location was the island of Ouessant, off the tip of Brittany. In Women and Children of Ouessant, families in a fishing village wait anxiously under a lowering sky for the men to return from the sea. The tension in their poses and facial expressions suggests they fear the fishermen are lost at sea.\r\n",
