  "text": "Although not well known today, Antoine Vollon was one of the most successful painters of his generation. After being rejected by the Salon jury of 1863 and participating in the infamous Salon des Refusés with the likes of Paul Cézanne and Édouard Manet, Vollon had two paintings accepted by the jury the following year. Soon recognition from critics and the public alike launched his ascent to popularity. An avid draftsman, Vollon made hundreds of drawings. Here he captured the essence of this Dutch scene in a surge of inspiration. His free and generous handling of the chalk mirrors the vigorous brushwork on his canvases of this period, especially his highly original landscapes.",
