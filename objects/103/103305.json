  "text": "This powerful portrait of an elderly Breton woman shows Georges Scott's prodigious talent as a watercolorist. The reflection of the potted plants in the shiny tabletop and the delicate texture of the woman's lace bonnet are just two examples of his admirable technical ability. Scott was known for his military pictures of World War I, so this early drawing comes as something of a revelation.\r\n",
