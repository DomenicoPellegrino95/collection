  "text": "In 1905 Charles Milcendeau purchased a plot of land in the heart of the Vend√©e marshes near his hometown of Soullans (but kept a flat in Paris). The property included a series of small, low-lying thatched houses called bourrines, along with some stables that he converted into a studio. In this drawing, he depicted his own bourrine, with its arched doorway, at the far left. The studio and other outbuildings\r\nlie to the right, beyond the two laborers. Despite this traditional subject matter, Milcendeau was experimental and forward-looking in his approach, combining various mediums including ink, watercolor, gouache, crayon, and charcoal, all worked with consummate skill.\r\n",
