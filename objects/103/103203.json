  "text": "The Belgian artist Xavier Mellery's ardent belief in the didactic power of art led him to dedicate much of his career to representing the lives of the working poor. His sensitive rendition of this peasant girl's forlorn expression, tattered clothing, and air of exhaustion reveals his empathy with the downtrodden. Rich chiaroscuro light effects give poignancy to this somber study.\r\n",
