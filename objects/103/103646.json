  "text": "During the Ming dynasty, the miniature jade mountain came to be used by the literati as a vehicle for expressing their longing for eremitism â€“ retreat from society into a life of reclusion in mountains. This small boulder, carved from Shoushan soapstone but representing the true spirit of the jade boulder, gives us a good opportunity to examine this unique phenomenon. Carved with rolling peaks to serve as a brush rest, the scene opens on the right with a grove of large trees with dense leaves. Beyond, to the left, is a seated scholar beside a bridge watching a waterfall cascading into a rocky pool. A multi-roomed retreat is nestled in a dense mass of trees and bushes at the mountain foot to the left of the boulder. The depiction of a scholar in contemplation by a waterfall as seen here was a popular theme in contemporary landscape painting. ",
