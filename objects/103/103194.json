  "text": "François Bonvin searched for models on the streets of Paris and brought them into his studio so he could make careful studies. He instructed them in a variety of poses and carefully rendered their tattered garments. It has been suggested that a young James McNeill Whistler saw this drawing of an old woman leaning wearily on her cane in Bonvin's studio and adapted her pose for the famous painting of his mother.\r\n",
