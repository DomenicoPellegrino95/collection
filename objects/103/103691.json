  "text": "The fabrics on this wall are all from Mark Pollack's current collection that has drawn its inspiration from the historic textile holdings at the Rhode Island School of Design, his alma mater. These panels, all made for use in 21st century homes, are a consummate statement about the designer's ability to move beyond structure to communicate the aesthetic statement.\r\n\r\nAll of the fabrics on this wall are complex structures woven in Switzerland on computer programmed and power-driven jacquard looms, the most sophisticated equipment available, and yet all of the fabrics were inspired by textiles hand-embroidered in the nineteenth century.  \r\n\r\n<I>Cascade<I> references the weeping willow trees depicted on American schoolgirl mourning embroideries. \r\n\r\n<I>Naxos<I> closely resembles the designs of needlework often done as dowry panels by young Greek girls living on the island of the same name.  \r\n\r\n<I>Peachy<I> communicates the same decorative inspiration as the omni present Turkish hand towels produced not only by skilled women in their homes, but also by several professional workshops in Istanbul during the late 19th century.\r\n",
