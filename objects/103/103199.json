  "text": "Born in Germany of English parents, Louis Welden Hawkins moved to France and trained as a painter at the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris. He lived in France for the rest\r\nof his life and took French nationality. Although his early works are in a realist vein, Hawkins was closely linked to the symbolist milieu. He was always a careful observer of female figures, in his realist as well as his symbolist phase. Peasant Woman in a Landscape is a straightforward and compassionate recording of the personality of this larger than-life figure.\r\n",
