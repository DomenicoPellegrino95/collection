  "text": "Charles Milcendeau rejected the traditional academic route to success and spent most of his time in his native region of the Vend√©e, living in the small village of Soullans. There he found suitable models for compositions of daily life like this scene of women making butter in their modest rural home. Even early in his career,\r\nwhen he was working in Paris, he would return home to sketch and paint the  peasants.\r\n",
