Wrapped around the waist so that the flowered end panels hang down in front, this type of sash became popular with north Indian courtiers in the mid-1600s and remained fashionable for the next 250 years. The sash's pastel hues and <I>lahariya<I> design were appropriate for <I>Holi<I>, a Hindu festival marking the end of the cold season and onset of spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd photograph",
