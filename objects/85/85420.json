  "text": "Repeating motifs are often used to create dynamic designs. The unit seen here has been repeated four times on a horizontal plane and then flipped to create the next row of the pattern.  Designers frequently used this technique by and was applied here to generate intense energy in a simple leaf and bud graphic.\r\n\r\nOriginal, painted drawings from the Larsen Archive (see case in this gallery) indicate that this was initially conceived as a more intricate pattern.  The decision to make the pattern unit bolder and slightly diffused made it well-suited to the warp print we see here.  \r\n",
