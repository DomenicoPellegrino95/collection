  "description": "See individual description below.  Early samples probably from school.  There were always sample warps on the Structos and other small looms in the studio.  Usually natural fibers, one or a mixture, and natural color.  None of these were in the line. Cream warp and weft.  Very sheer.  Warp variation probably manipulated after weaving.  Slippery weft.
