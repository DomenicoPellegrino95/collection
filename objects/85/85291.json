  "description": "See individual description below.  Early samples probably from school.  There were always sample warps on the Structos and other small looms in the studio.  Usually natural fibers, one or a mixture, and natural color.  None of these were in the line. Open plain weave, white warp with alternating sections of brown and metallic weft. (brown, white, bronze metallic)",
