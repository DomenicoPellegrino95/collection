  "text": "Geometric motifs and patterns comprise one of the largest categories of design elements used in the creation of African textiles. In <I>Caravan</I>, Swedish designer Anita Askild captures the improvisational quality often present in the African aesthetic. The seemingly random placement of forms and colors combines with variations in size and orientation in a way that encourages the eye to move across the fabric in much the same way that traditional <I>Kuba</I> design does.",
