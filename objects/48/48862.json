  "text": "Lovis Corinth knew a woman's cruelty firsthand through his mother. She was a 40-year-old widow with five children when she married farmer Franz Heinrich Corinth, then 29. Lovis was their only child together. She cared so little for the boy that he actually feared for his life. Scholars think that Corinth's childhood had a bearing on his art, and one example may be his 22 illustrations for The Book of Judith. The real weapons here, it seems, are Judith's bared breasts. The facial expressions are Corinth's own, sketched from looking in the mirror.",
