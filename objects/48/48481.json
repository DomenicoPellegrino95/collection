  "text": "It's no surprise Anthony Gross's father was a map-maker. His prints are dense networks of lines and virtuosic etching techniques. For subject matter, Gross reveled in the ruck. He was drawn to the insouciant, transient jumble of ordinary life. Gross etched La Jetée for Le Jeune Gravure Contemporaine, a society of printmakers in Paris he joined in 1933. The tireless Gross made nearly 400 prints, but was equally acclaimed for his paintings, animated films and book illustrations.",
