  "text": "Martin Schongauer's fierce linework reflects the loathing aimed at Christ in the Passion literature. The scourge on the ground at left is an especially grisly detail. The texts said that to compound Christ's suffering, his tormentors tied iron hooks, weights and other sharp devices (including dried ox tendons) to their whips, to better tear at his flesh. ",
