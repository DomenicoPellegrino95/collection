  "text": "According to legend, the citizens of Selena had so much trouble with a dragon roaming the countryside that they fed it humans to appease it. Just when it was Princess Cleodolinda's turn to be sacrificed-she is the frightened figure on the right-a Roman tribune named George happened by. He blessed himself and set about slaying the fearsome beast. Onlookers were so moved by Saint George's faith in God's help that they promptly converted to Christianity.  ",
