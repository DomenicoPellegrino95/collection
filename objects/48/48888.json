  "text": "Death comes as an angel to embrace a bed-ridden figure. As he does so, he begins the transformation of the body into a skeleton, with his fingers serving as ribs. For many years Christian Rohlfs painted in Naturalistic and then Impressionistic styles, but at the age of 60, he fully adopted the young Expressionists' raw, emotional approach to art.  ",
