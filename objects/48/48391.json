  "text": "Hans Beham ranks among the German printmakers in Nuremburg whom scholars call the <I>Little Masters<I> because of the extreme smallness oftheir prints.  Early northern engravers were not trained in drawing the nude, as Beham's female nude attests.  More skillful and anatomically correct depictions of nudes by Durer opened the way for other artists.",
