  "text": "The grotesque fascinates, wrote one art historian, because it depicts a realm in which the boundaries separating humans, animals, and plants are subverted. This Bacchanalian print depicts such a world, where a satyr spews drink, torsos sprout from grapes, goats serve as drapery holdbacks, and bald-headed felines cast a sinister gaze outward. ",
