  "text": "Norval Morrisseau is considered by many as the founder of contemporary Anishinabe painting.  Morrisseau's work takes iconography from traditional art such as carvings and etchings on rocks or birch bark scrolls and recreates it in modern style media.  Similar to Minnesota artist George Morrison, Morrisseau's artistic style combines his Anishinabe background with today's styles. This is the last painting in a series of six that depict a man changing into a thunderbird. This kind of bird plays a powerful role in traditional Anishinabe religious beliefs. According to tradition, thunder and lightning occurs only when a thunderbird flaps its wings and blinks its eyes.  The thunderbird manifests itself differently among the Plains and Great Lakes/ Woodlands tribes.    ",
