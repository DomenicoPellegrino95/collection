  "text": "Medieval theologians interpreted Christ's life and death in terms of Old Testament events, a practice called typology. The legend of Lamech being beaten by his two wives was said to foretell that Christ would be scourged by \"two types of people,\" a Gentile and a Jew. This may explain the strangely contrasting floggers in Jerome Wierix's print. ",
