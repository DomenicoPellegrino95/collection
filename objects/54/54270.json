  "text": "This engraving is one of Lucas van Leyden's finest, displaying his prodigious talent for establishing intrigue. David's popularity after slaying Goliath made King Saul livid. Making matters worse for Saul, God afflicted him with an evil spirit (1 Samuel 19:9). Now almost maniacally unstable, with fidgety feet and locked eyes, the king tightens his grip on the javelin as David futilely tries to calm him. Lucas leaves the viewer wondering whether Saul will carry out his threat to pin David to the wall. The gesturing figure at back is believed to be a self-portrait.\r\n",
