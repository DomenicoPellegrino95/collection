  "text": "Félix Bracquemond delighted in displays of naturalistic precision, and winged creatures provided some of his best subjects. The arresting Upper Part of a Door Panel brought him his first acclaim as a graphic artist, although critics couldn't tell if the print was intended as a nature study or a moral lesson about the predators who walk among us. Nailed to the door are a dead crow, a horned owl, a bat, and a sparrow hawk, along with a verse distinguishing \"flying and plundering.\" Bracquemond gained additional renown for alerting the Paris art world to Japanese woodblock prints, which he discovered when he spotted some prints that had been used as packing material in a shipment of porcelain from Japan.",
