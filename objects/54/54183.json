  "text": "Nineteenth-century landowners paid to have birds of prey shot, seeing them as vermin that competed for the landowners’ game birds. There was also a superstition in France that raptors spent their nights secretly feeding on dead bodies. This milieu gave rise to Félix Bracquemond’s etching, remarkable for the realism of the crow, bat, horned owl, and sparrowhawk nailed to the door. The inscription begins, “Here you see sadly suspended / Birds predatory and lustful.”",
