  "text": "The Netherlands developed its own version of the grotesque, characterized by heavy, three-dimensional forms. Cornelis Floris pioneered the style in Antwerp, inspired by a visit to Rome in 1538. An architect as well as a sculptor, Floris populated this superstructure with satyrs, caryatids, terms, and masks. Some of his favorite devices are also visible--string, birds with string, holes, and figures enclosed by straps. In the upper cavity, smoke trails from Vulcan's forge. ",
