  "text": "When not attending to the wine god Bacchus, satyrs searched out the company of nymphs. This meticulous engraving by Amsterdam goldsmith Abraham van den Hecken portrays a satyr and nymph in an amorous embrace, framed by cupids and superb half-torso, half-tendril grotesques. Appropriate to the animal pleasures celebrated at center, the design was probably intended for the interior of a shallow gold or silver drinking cup. The inscription reminds us to seize the day. Translated, it reads: \"Our days on earth [are] as an hour.\"",
