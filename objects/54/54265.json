  "text": "Joseph was such a good servant that the Egyptian captain Potiphar elevated him to major-domo. But being \"comely in features and comely to look at\" (Genesis 39:6), he also drew the attention of Potiphar's lecherous and bitter wife. She propositioned him repeatedly until one day, she cast off her shoes and wedding ring (on the table at right) and lunged at him. Although Joseph escaped, the spiteful woman accused him of rape and had him jailed. ",
