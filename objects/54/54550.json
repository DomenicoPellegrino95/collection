  "text": "Produced as a benefit for the New Lincoln School, a private experimental school in New York City, this editioned lithograph was based directly on a photographic collage Rauschenberg made for the project. The inclusion of the image of the rocket anticipates Rauschenberg's important series of prints, the Stoned Moon series, which were completed in 1969 at Gemini G.E.L. print workshop, Los Angeles, in commemoration of the Apollo 11 moon landing. This lithograph was the only editioned print that Rauschenberg completed in 1966.",
