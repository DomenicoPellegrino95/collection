  "text": "During his exile in the wilderness during the reign of King Saul, David, the heir-apparent to the crown of Israel asked farmers in Carmel to provide supplies for his troops. Nabal, the son of Caleb and the local ruler refused to honor David's request; he is described in the Bible as \"a churlish and evil in his doings.\" In retribution for his refusal of aid, David threatened to slaughter his household. Nabal's wife Abigail recognized David's right to petition and appeased the future king by bringing an elaborate feast to David and his men. David granted mercy to Nabal but when the latter learned of Abigail's deed, he fell ill and died. David then took Abigail as his own wife.",
