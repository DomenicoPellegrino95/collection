  "text": "Saint Francis is one of Lucas's most highly respected devotional images --dating from the second decade of the sixteenth century. Narrative element is minimalized --with the exception of his Franciscan habit, his stigmata, his vision of the crucifix and the belt symbolizing with three knots --the vows of obedience, poverty and chastity.\u000b\u000bIt has been speculated that this engraving would have been marketed to the sewing, knitting, and clothing guilds of Saint Francis.",
