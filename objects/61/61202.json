  "text": "Hiroshige depicted Fukagawa, Edo's lumberyard, in snow. Drying lumber leans against wooden supports in the foreground, while a canal filled with logs zigzags into the distance. The earlier edition (left) shows the scene under a pale gray, daytime sky. The darker sky of the later edition (right) suggests an evening scene or impending rain. ",
