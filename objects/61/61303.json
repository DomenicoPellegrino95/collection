  "text": "The swells promenade London’s Hyde Park. The statue of Achilles reminds us of how far they have departed from classical notions of male perfection. And, there may be another layer to the joke. Achilles is the most famous cross-dresser in history. Fearing for his safety, his parents dressed him as a girl in an attempt to keep him from being dragooned into military service. Just to know what’s what, one fellow takes the precaution of observing the scene through a monocle in the grip of his riding switch.",
