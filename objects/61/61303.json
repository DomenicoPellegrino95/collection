  "text": "Published annually between 1816 and 1825, this celebrated series of prints satirized the most absurd fashion crazes of the year. Ladies and gentleman appear preposterously overdressed as they parade for one another through London's Hyde Park. The women are shown in full, brightly colored dresses and extravagant hats that are elaborately adorned with ribbons and feathers. Men wear stirruped trousers that balloon at the hip like a lady's skirt, along with narrow cutaway jackets, garish shirts with large or ruffled collars, and high top hats. ",
