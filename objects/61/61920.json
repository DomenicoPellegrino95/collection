  "text": "This small bamboo brush holder is deeply carved depicting a crab nestling into a group of lotus pods. The technique used here is called <I>hsien-ti shen-k'e<I> or \"sunken ground deep carving,\" a technique developed by Ch'ing artisans in the early part of the Ch'ien-lung reign (1736-1795). The relatively naturalistic carving is derived from small format painting and the eyes of the crab are inlaid with hardstone.",
