  "text": "While learning to wield a chainsaw from free-form furniture maker and sculptor J.B. Blunk, Mitchell studied pre-Columbian pottery, stone carving, metalwork, and textiles.  <I>Muse #3<I> seems to echo that interest, but Mitchell's primary inspiration is always his relationship with wood.\r\n\r\n<P>\"Within the graceful bulk of stately trees lies an exquisite palette of patterns and colors waiting to be revealed.  When I cut open one of those jewels of the forest I become a witness to how elemental forces have shaped the life of that tree.  I feel those same forces have somehow inspired my own growth and development as a sculptor.\"",
