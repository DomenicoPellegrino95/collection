  "text": "As part of a series of fan prints depicting famous poetesses, Hiroshige featured Lady Murasaki, the author of the eleventh-century novel Genji monogatari (Tale of Genji), for this design. He was inspired by the following poem (inscribed in the red cartouche).\r\n\r\n\tSince the evening when my friend was cremated,\r\n\tthe name of Shiogama (salt-making pot) \t\r\n                has become a reminder of him \r\n\r\nReferring to the long history of salt making in a beach town in northeast Japan, the poem relates the name of the beach with the death of Murasaki's friend, who had been recently cremated. The smoke coming from the beach huts reminds Murasaki of the recent funerary rites.  \r\n",
