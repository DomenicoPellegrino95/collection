  "text": "A great number of <I>mei-p'ing<I> with painted decoration were made for use as wine jars from the twelfth through fourteenth centuries. Various Tz'u-chou kilns in the north produced designs painted in black against a white slip and it is possible that the similarity to ink painting accounted in part for this ware's popularity. Vessels of this tall, elongated shape, with sharply turned-back rim were frequently decorated with feathery, frond-like patterns comprised of short, flickering brush-strokes. This distinctive painting style has been associated with wares made at kilns in Yu-hsien in Honan province. The spontaneous, casual brushwork characteristic of much painted Tz'u-chou ware is less evident in this rather carefully painted, beautifully preserved example. The lower register is decorated with bisected lotus petals and the entire design is protected under a clear glaze. The dating of the vessel is confirmed by a thermoluminessence test.",
