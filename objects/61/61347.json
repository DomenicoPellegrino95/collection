  "text": "The idea behind the series Famous Places of the Sixty-odd Provinces was to show one image for each of Japan's sixty-six provinces. Although some Japanese provinces are mountainous, the great majority are along the coasts where most people lived and worked. This print captures a bird's eye view of the west coast of Kyñshñ Island in southern Japan. V-shaped inlets lead to coastal plains from which mountains rise dramatically. In Hiroshige's composition, the boldly striped sail of a ship in the foreground gives a sense of distance to the shore.      \r\n\r\n",
