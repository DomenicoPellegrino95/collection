  "text": "Born in Lyon, France, Marguerite Wildenhain attended the Bauhaus in Weimar, Germany between 1919 and 1925. During the late 1920s and early 1930s, she worked as a designer for various German ceramic factories. In 1933, due to the rise of Nazism in Germany, she and her husband Frans Wildenhain moved first to the Netherlands; in 1940 she moved to the United States. She taught at the College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland, California, and in 1945 founded Pond Farm Pottery, a workshop and summer school, in Guerneville, California.  Wildenhain continued to run Pond Farm Pottery until her death in 1985. \r\n\r\nWildenhain was a strong influence on functional pottery in this country, writing three books on the subject.  By the 1950s, she rejected mass produced work, promoting the crafts ethic and aesthetic. This elegantly flared bowl shows the characteristic minimalism of her early work, still strongly influenced by her Bauhaus training.",
