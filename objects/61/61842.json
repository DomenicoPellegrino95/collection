  "text": "The Indian Pavilion at the 1888 International Exhibition in Glasgow, Scotland sparked Britain's interest in all things Indian.  Designers adapted the Indian style for the British palate, known as Anglo-Indian design, which this tea set demonstrates.  The teapot's angled handle and curved spout recall Indian examples, while the basic profile of the pieces remain traditionally western.  The raised foliage introduces another exotic element, yet it is contained within horizontal bands.  Signs of the zodiac run the length of the center band.",
