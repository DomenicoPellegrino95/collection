  "text": "A stone bridge famous for its dramatic round shape was a well-known landmark in the southeast Edo. Earlier editions of this print design show a light gray sky and a pale blue river, as if the snow is falling during the daytime. Prints from a later edition show a darker, blue-gray sky, as if at nighttime. The white dots meant to represent snow in the earlier edition, appear to be stars in the later edition because of the darkness of the sky. ",
