  "text": "In 1981, rather late in his career, Ettore Sottsass founded a Milan-based design movement called Memphis, which brought him considerable fame.  The shared mission of its Italian members was that “a product’s form is not the ultimate purpose, but rather a starting point from which to establish a relationship with its users.”  While the mission’s exact meaning was open to interpretation, its implied reaction to the long-held precept, “form follows function” is apparent.  Color, pattern, synthetic materials and eccentric forms were often the result, particularly in their furniture designs.",
