  "text": "The <I>sombrero</I>, or wide-brimmed straw hat, is recognized by its high, pinched crown.  While dyed palm leaves are often woven into colorful stripes around a sombrero's crown, this particular example has been further decorated with numerous imported ribbons of silk and wool. These ribbons would shimmer and sway to the movement of the wearer. An attention-grabbing hat like this is an apt headpiece for a village leader who would have worn it to a community-wide celebration.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, more and more men have adopted Western dress, replacing the straw sombrero with plain brown or black felt hats.\r\n",
