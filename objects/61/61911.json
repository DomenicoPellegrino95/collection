  "text": "Impressed tomb tiles of the Han dynasty (206 b.c.-a.d.220) show aristocrats eating from small tables such as this one. During this period, large scale furniture was not in use and most dining was done in a kneeling posture on floor mats. Food was served on individual trays raised on short legs that functioned as tables. By Han, exquisitely painted lacquer utensils were amongst the most luxurious items in upper class households and were valued above ceramics and bronze. Certain lacquer objects were enhanced with precious metal inlay or, as the case with this table, with gilt bronze legs. This object awaits conservation, it appears just as it was found after centuries of burial, but its warpage can be corrected and its color brightened.",
