  "text": "Gourd-shaped vases seemed to have vanished between the mid-fourteenth and mid-sixteenth centuries. They reappeared around 1550 and achieved great popularity. Such vases were made from four thrown parts consisting of four reversed bowl-shaped elements carefully luted together at the waist and at the midpoint of each bulb. Gourd vases of the Chia-ching era were decorated in blue and white, red and green overglaze enamels as well as the yellow ground underglaze blue technique seen here.",
