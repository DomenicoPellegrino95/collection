  "text": "Cast in fine detail, this small, human figure stands formally posed with arms held out and fingers curled to form a socket which would have held the shank of an oil lamp. The figure wears a long tunic with flared skirt gathered at the waist by a plain belt secured by a belt hook. The skirt, sleeves, shoulders, and lapels of the costume have been inlaid with gold line decoration and cast with border motifs. The hair is carefully dressed and partially covered by a close-fitting headdress with a double-lobed crest in the center.\r\n<P>Human figures in bronze were rare throughout the Shang and early Chou dynasties (1600-770 b.c.), but several bronze figures which served as lamp standards have now been excavated from Warring States period (475-221 b.c.) tombs of the late Chou era. The strong, sculptural quality points to the naturalism encountered in the succeeding Ch'in (221 -206 b.c.) and Western Han (206-8 a.d.) eras.",
