  "text": "After studying at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, Verner Panton worked from 1950-52 with Danish architect and designer Arne Jacobsen before establishing a studio in Switzerland in 1955. He set himself apart from other Scandinavian designers by adopting stylistic elements from the United States and Italy, favoring steel wire and colorful plastics over wood. The rounded pads of the cone chair and the wire construction resemble 1950s furniture designs by Americans George Nelson and Harry Bertoia, respectively.  Panton's work covers the design spectrum, including architecture, textiles, furniture, lighting and exhibitions. \r\n\r\nHighly futuristic, Panton's series of <I>Cone<I> chairs resulted from a conscious effort to eliminate any preconceived notions of how a chair should look. Eschewing the traditional four-leg structure became a hallmark identified with his chair designs throughout the  '50s and '60s, including fabric-covered versions of the cone chair.\r\n\r\n",
