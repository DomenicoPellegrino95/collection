  "text": "Patterned after a multi-petal lotus blossom and decorated with sanskrit characters (<I>Ihantsa<I>), this elevated bowl probably functioned as an offering vessel on a Buddhist altar. It belongs to a small group of underglaze blue bowls in this unique shape all bearing non-Chinese characters as part of the decoration. Such bowls appear to have been made during the late Ming and early Ch'ing era for use in Lamaistic temples. This piece bears a six-character Wan-li reign mark on the inside of the foot-rim. The lotus petals are crisply outlined in a deep blue against brilliant white.",
