  "text": "Imperial porcelains of the brief Yung-cheng reign (1723-35) often represent the pinnacle of technical refinement. Building on the innovations of the preceeding K'ang-hsi era (1662-1722), certain Yung-cheng monochromes were rather opaque, low temperature glazes fired in a variety of bright colors in an enameling or muffle kiln. Crimson-pink, turquoise, coral, and aubergine in addition to several shades of green and yellow were developed in this technique.\r\n<P>This exquisite plate is moulded in vague imitation of a lotus blossom; with seed pod in the center encircled by two concentric zones of overlapping petals. The design and deep rich yellow glaze are exceptionally refined.",
