  "text": "Ceramic pillows were produced over several centuries throughout China, but the northern Tz'u-chou kilns supplied a volume and variety greater than all others. In addition to the predominant black and white designs, were Tz'u-chou pillows decorated with colorful lead-silicate glazes in a technique that first flourished in the eighth century during the T'ang dynasty. Called <I>san-ts'ai<I> or \"three-color\" ware, this technique usually combined green and yellow glazes on a cream slip to produce a three color effect.\r\n<P>The d√©cor of this quadrangular pillow is clearly articulated with a finely carved white lotus blossom surrounded by large stylized green leaves against a black ground. On the bottom, is a rare twenty-three character brushed ink inscription dating the piece to \"the first year of the emperor Ming Chang's reign in the twelfth month of year <I>keng wu.<I>\" This accords with 1190 a.d. of the Chin dynasty. The name Liu Chung-i also appears along with a partially obscured honorific title. Self-dated ceramics are extremely rare and this inscription points to the importance such works held for the well-furnished tomb.\r\n",
