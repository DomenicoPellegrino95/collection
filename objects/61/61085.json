  "text": "Odawara is located near Mount Hakone, in a region renowned for its natural hot springs. Here, Hiroshige shows Mount Hakone rising in the distance beyond the Sakawagawa River. In the foreground, Kunisada depicted a female visitor to the area who has just emerged from one of the hot springs and now loosely wears an informal blue and white cotton robe (<I>yukata<I>). A young girl attempts to sell the woman locally crafted toys and decorative boxes.",
