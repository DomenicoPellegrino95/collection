  "text": "Porcelain produced during the Liao dynasty (916-1125) is relatively rare and this elegant vessel is further distinguished by its large size and fine condition. Stoutly potted of ovoid form with a full cylindrical neck, its decoration consists of only two thread relief bands on the shoulder and neck and a rolled-out lip rim. It stands on a flat, rimless foot and its finely crackled, transparent glaze reveals a smooth porcelain body. The unevenly applied glaze has pooled in areas around the shoulder affecting a greenish-blue tone where the glaze has thickened\r\n<P>While both the Ting and the Tz'u-chou kilns in north China came under Khitan control with the founding of Liao, white wares remained in production. Early Ting porcelains often have a blue-tinged glaze distinct from the yellowish tint characteristic of later Ting ware. This color shift was due to a change in kiln fuel from wood to coal which occurred sometime around the tenth century. A large vase of similar form has been excavated from a Liao tomb in Fa-ku county, Liaoning province.",
