  "text": "Hiroshige's Eight Views of Ømi, published around 1834, is a rather unusual series. Intended to be a \"pure landscape\" series, the images include very few figures. In addition, the color scheme for the first edition was printed in black and white with the minimum use of color, an approach which made them look like ink paintings. Customers didn't respond well to this artistic approach so the publisher had the printers add more color in later editions. This print, from a later edition, still somewhat shows Hiroshige's original intention. In the tradition of the Eight-View series of Ømi, the \"floating temple\" at Katada was included in the depiction of the theme of \"homing geese.\" As seen here, a portion of the temple was built on a pier, making it a site of great picturesque beauty.
