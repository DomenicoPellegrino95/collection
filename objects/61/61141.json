  "text": "\"The construction of this tzedakah box plays on the interrelated nature of tzedakah, community, and money.  By using money as a central visual and structural element of the box, I wanted to demonstrate how money permeates the charitable community infrastructure.  Money used as tzedakah becomes a righteous mortar that holds our community institutions together.  Tzedakah transforms and elevates money to a higher moral plane beyond commerce.  The pennies are inseparable from the walnut elements, which symbolize community.\"  Phil Rosenbloom",
