  "text": "This silver stirrup-spout vessel depicting an Andean supernatural anthropomorphic jaguar is likely a product of the 20th century, inspired by ancient Chimú-style objects. Historically, ancient Chimú metalwork mimicked ceramic pottery forms like stirrup spouts and portrait pots. In Chimú society, the selection of metal over ceramics would have reflected the owner's high status.",
