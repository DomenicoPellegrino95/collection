The ground of the sky area is covered with a swastika fret diaper on which appear sprawling, white-eyed clouds, the 12-symbols, bats carrying swastikas, jui scepters, etc, and good luck characters.  Border of unusually narrow slanting wavy stripes topped by a narrow strip of clouds tightly massed, and a double row of billows in which appear the Buddhist symbols and Precious Things.  Note the unusual treatment of the wine cups.  Robe slit at sides and lined with yellow damask with double jui medallions.  Band and cuffs of blue-black satin embroidered in blue and gold.",
