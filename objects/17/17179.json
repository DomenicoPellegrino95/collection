On Second seal \\'Han Lin Ping Chen\\'(Han Ling a member of the Imperial Academy of Literature; Ping Cheng the cyclical year 1856 whin he entered the Academy.  Note  Tien Huang, produced in Shou Shan in Foo-Kien is a rare stone for making seals in China.  Examples of this size extremely rare.  The late dates of the characters on these 18th century seals are derived from the fact that scholars collected old seals and put their names on them after grinding off name of previous owner.",
