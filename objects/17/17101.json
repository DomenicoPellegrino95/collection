  "text": "Included in a 1944 Wadsworth Athenaeum exhibition called “Ancient Peruvian Art,” the skull was originally attributed to the Chimú and dated to the fifth or sixth century. However, it is most likely a 20th-century work inspired by ancient Andean metalwork and crafted to meet a demand for such ancient works that began in the 1930s. There is a long tradition of skull-shaped vessels in ancient Andean art, and such works have always been popular with collectors.",
