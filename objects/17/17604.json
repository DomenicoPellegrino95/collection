  "text": "The two tiger amulets, bird hairpin, and finial decorated with a composite serpent human motif, although exceptionally rare, are products of a major Shang dynasty industry, bone carving. The stylized animals and conventional motifs found on bronze vessels are also encountered in carved bone suggesting similar emblematic purposes. All of these items were likely personal adornments rather than ceremonial objects.",
