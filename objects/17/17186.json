In the upper body three gold five-clawed dragons pursue the heavenly jewel in a field of loosely drawn clouds interspersed with Taoist symbold and scattered peonies.  Border of slanting wavy stripes topped by large billows and circles from which emerge groups of clouds in jui form, rocky pinacles topped with narcissus, bats, jewels, and Eight Precious Things.  Note that cloud heads in striped area stray well down into the stripes, appearing to weave in and out of the stripes at intervals.  Soft tones of yellow, red, blue, mauve and green.  some painted detail.  K\\'o ssu fine and closely woven.  Pieced at upper left shoulder and torn in body area.",
