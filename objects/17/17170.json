  "description": "Valance shaped, of faded rust-red, K\\'ossu bordered by a dark blue band carrying sprays of various flowers.  In the field, five five-clawed dragons, three in gold and two in pale blue, pursue the heavenly jewel among lossely drawn clouds and bats.  At the base of the side panels, slanting wavy stripes scattered with jui-type clouds and rolling billows.  Spray, jewels and artemesia leaf emerge from waves.  Across the top of the valance a broad band of bluish-green K;ossu carrying large sparys of peonies flanked by phoenix in flight.  Dominant colors are rust, blue, brown, cream and deep peach.  K\\'ossu closely woven.  Lining of tan cotton.",
