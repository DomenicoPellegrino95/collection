  "description": "Axe head of long, thin proportion with four points at back and blade with strait upper edge; lower edge is straight for half of its length and then is cut back into a sharp curve to socket forming a hook-like projection; both edges of blade have T-shaped flange which, together with the thickness of form, suggests this was probably used as a pick; socket is a hole 5/8 in. in diameter drilled through axe head just forward from the points at back and tapering into blade at its narrowest part; tip broken and repaired, possibly reconstructed.",
