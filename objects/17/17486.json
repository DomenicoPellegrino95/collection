  "text": "Before Pittsburgh had Three Rivers Stadium, it had Forbes Field. The picturesque ballpark with its distinctive 86-foot-high right-field roof was home to the Pittsburgh Pirates for 61 years. It's where Babe Ruth hit his last career home runs (May 25, 1935), and where Pirate Bill Mazeroski hit his ninth-inning home run in Game 7 to win the 1960 World Series. Another Forbes Field fact: No one ever pitched a no-hitter there. The field was torn down in 1970; the University of Pittsburgh now occupies the site. Inside a campus building, imbedded in glass, sits home plate. ",
