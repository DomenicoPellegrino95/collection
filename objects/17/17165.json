The back of the jar is decorated with four vertical rows of crudely drawn heads in profile painted in brick red and buff.  Design and workmanship primitive.  Jar restored.",

  "text": "This vessel depicts the principal rayed deity of Tiwanaku. The deity's headdress radiates appendages that terminate in puma and bird heads. The figure’s eyes, two black and white circles, are divided vertically; above and below the eyes, the face is painted with a bird located toward the chin. Below the head is a pyramidal structure that may reference the Akapana pyramid, Tiwanaku’s principle shrine. The back of the vessel depicts seven trophy heads, an allusion to the ritual practice of decapitating the heads of enemies following victory in war.",
