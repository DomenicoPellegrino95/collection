  "text": "Spatulas were used to extract lime or other alkaline substances from a special container, usually a hollowed-out gourd. The alkaline substance was mixed with coca leaves or other medicinal plants to strengthen the potency of the various alkaloids within the plants. The ingestion of such substances had a religious and ceremonial significance, and often aided religious practitioners in contacting beings of the spirit realm.",
