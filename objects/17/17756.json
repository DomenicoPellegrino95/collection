  "description": "The decor displays outstanding elements of the Middle Chou repertoire on a vessel reminiscent in profile of an earlier Hu (50.46.26, Karlgren number 19).  An eyed band with diagonals appears on the foot and on the belly is a system of scale bands in flat relief, imitating straps around the flask.  Big lozenges in high, peaked relief occur at the junction of these bands.  An identical scale band decorates the neck, which has, in its narrowest part, two small handles.  These, with two free animals\\' heads, achieve a division into four sections.  The handles are adorned with t\\'ao-t\\'ieh heads (rare int he Middle Chou style and usually found on such accesory parts as handles or legs).  The scale band is repeated for the third time on the lid  a functional member in that the ring-shaped top can serve as a foot if the lid, inverted, is turned into a cup.  Patina  green with patches of red.",
