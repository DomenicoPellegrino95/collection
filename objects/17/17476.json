  "text": "Chairs with this decorative back-splat are often called \"Salem chairs\" because many have been traced back to families from that area.  Its inspiration derives from a design in Robert Manwaring's Cabinet and Chair-Maker's Real Friend and Companion (1765).  The pattern book was widely circulated in England and America, and seems to have enjoyed a particularly strong impact on form and decoration in Massachusetts.",
