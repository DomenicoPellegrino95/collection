  "text": "The appearance of certain animals played an important role in ancient beliefs regarding omens and portents, and a complex system of thought that spanned the Han (206 b.c.-220 a.d.), the Six Dynasties, and T'ang period (618-906). The earliest appearance of the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac is in funerary sculpture like these found in northern Chinese tombs dating to the northern Wei dynasty (386-535).\r\n<P>Almost all early examples represent human bodies in kneeling or standing positions with animal heads. Unfortunately, few full sets of all twelve animals survive from the early period. These are typical T'ang examples. They relate closely to a full set excavated near Sian, the ancient T'ang capital, which also portrays the figures dressed in formal, long-sleeved robes. Depicted here are the cockerel, horse, snake, dragon, and monkey.\r\n",
