  "description": "The decor of interlaced serpents on this example stems from a bovine mask at the base of the grip.  The forehead shield of the mask rises in stages in low relief toward the top of the grip, where it is delimited by a band of running spirals.  The sides of the mask, with eyes and horns in relief, occupy the sides of the grip where it joins the tube, into which it is fitted.  Between the mask and the spiral band, the coiled serpents with striated bodies cover the surface of the grip.  The top of the handle, deeply nicked on both sides, is presumably part of the tang.  patina  grey-green on grip, brighter green with blue patches and small areas of dull red on the tube.",
