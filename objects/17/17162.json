Two animal heads in relief project from shoulders in back, and a small animal, possibly a dog, stands astride the brimmed hat worn by the figure.  A bar is held out in front of the body in hands that have no form.  This bar, possibly a musical instrument, and details of the costume, are painted in red and cream stripes and dots on a reddish pottery ground.  Wooden stand.  Close to \\'Ixtlan del Rio\\' type.",
