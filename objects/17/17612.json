  "description": "Two tigers, each turned back on itself to bite the tail of the other, form this belt hook.  The bellies, legs, and necks of the beasts are adorned with striated bands, the haunches with spirals.  A scale band outlines the sinuous curves of the backbone and the throats.  The hook terminates in a serpent\\'s head.  The stud emerges in the back from the junction of the snakes\\' bodies.  Patina grey-green with small areas of sharp green.",
