  "description": "This cap is unusual in that it still has the linch pins.  The closed end of the cap, set off from the pin end by a triple band in rounded relief, is decorated with a broad wavy band enclosing, in the inner loop, a figure reminiscent of a cicada.  In the outer loop of the wave is a scale-like motif.  The top of the linch-pin is formed of an animal\\'s head with spiral horns curving inward.  They are executed in heavy, thread-like relief.  The ears are formed of a large spiral and the snout is blunt and heavy.  Patina grey-green",
