  "text": "Liverpool gained a reputation in the 18th century for elegant creamwares with transfer-printed scenes created for the lucrative trade with America.  Among the images of American eagles and ships with American flags were apotheosis designs in honor of George Washington (1732-99), the first American icon, as seen here.  Washington's qualities of fortitude, judgment, and sense of duty made him a constant inspiration to Americans and Europeans alike.",
