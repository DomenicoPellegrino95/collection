  "text": "This richly decorated special occasion gown features a scattered scheme of multicolored seasonal flowers (peony, orchid, plum, peach, magnolia, lotus, chrysanthemum, and morning glory) and cicada moths against a medium of green ground. The cuffs feature sprays of multicolored seasonal flowers while the inner cuff bands and borders display crane roundels alternating with bats (representing happiness) against a dark blue ground. This robe symbolizes the classic Chinese ideal of harmony with nature. The floral imagery represents seasonal change with the specific flowers signifying different months of the year. The cicada, which emerges in spring to complete its life cycle, suggests renewal and regeneration. Together, the insects and flower promote the ideal of a harmonious coexistence of all living things.",
