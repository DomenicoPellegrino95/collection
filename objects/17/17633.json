  "description": "These birds having crests, ears, and horns, may be classified as magical animals.  The bodies are adorned with incised spirals, the shoulder line being emphasized by a large comma figure in round relief.  the wings, spread flat, are bordered with a striated band.  In their claws the birds clutch a beast (snake?) with two bodies which curve out from the birds' claws and end in a flourish with double curves at the base of the birds' breasts.  The eyeballs have the form of raised knobs with hollow centers.  It is probable that these birds served as accessory members to some object, possibly a vase, inasmuch as the beaks curve into rings to permit passage of a handle.  Patina grayed-green with areas of darker green.",
