  "description": "Taoist priest robe with couched gold ground embroidered with silk and silk floss in satin stitch and couching.  On the back the customary pagoda medallion flanked by the Sun and Moon symbols.  In the field, tight, white-eyed clouds, two large dragon medallions, bats carrying various good luck emblems, white cranes, double peaches and Taoist symbols.  At the bottom of the field the Heavenly Sea.  The front of the robe is adorned at the shoulders with large medallions carrying frontal dragons.  Beneathe each medallion is a pagoda resting on a heap of clouds.  In the field, tight clouds, bats, cranes and Buddhist symbols.  The borders are embroidered in couched silk twist with Buddhist symbols, dragons, carp, Precious Things, clouds and other symbols.  The border sections are of fine workmanship and are undoubtedly older that the major portion of the robe itself.",
