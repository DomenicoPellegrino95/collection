  "description": "The rendering of these birds, achieved with the simplest of means, results in a strikingly lifelike portrayal. The tilt of the heads and the rather stylized conformation of wings and tail by incised lines contribute strongly to this impression.  The treatment of the tail is the same as that to be seen on a bird dress hook in the museum of Far Eastern Antiquities in Stolkholm (see Karlgren Number 95, figure 75). Patina pale green.",
