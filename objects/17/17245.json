  "description": "Prayer Rug, Kulah. The prayer field of rose-red is filled with diagonal rows of stiff floral motifs in soft green. The area above and around the prayer field is soft blue, becoming darker at top, with rows of single flowers in red and white. Above and below the main field is a variation of the typical Kulah S-scroll border with single blossoms on a dark blue ground. The border contains 18 narrow stripes of rose, white, brown and green filled with conventionalized blossoms and geometric motifs. Sides selvaged and the ends finished with a narrow web fringed with warp threads. Ghiordes knot with 12 knots per lineal inch. Wool warp and woof. Nap well worn down.",
