Crimson bats, good-luck characters, and the traditional 12 symbols appear in the field. Deep border of slanting, wavy stripes topped with swags of clouds and waves and billows. Heaps of jewels and Precious Things appear in the waves and branches of coral emerge from them. Painted areas in the wave section. Border band of blue-black k\\'ossu with waves, dragons etc. Medium blue sleeves striped horizontally with gold and dark blue k\\'ossu cuffs, these last probably modern. Lining of yellow silk. Slit at sides.",
