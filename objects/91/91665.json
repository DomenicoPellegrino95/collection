  "text": "In China bats have long been considered lucky creatures because the written symbol for \"bat\" has the same pronunciation as that for \"happiness.\" Consequently, bats are frequently featured in textile patterns and porcelain designs in both China and Japan. Since the perfection of the full moon is also viewed as an auspicious occurrence, the combination of a bat and the moon suggests exponential happiness. ",
