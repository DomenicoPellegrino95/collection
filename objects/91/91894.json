  "text": "Susan Schwalb has adapted the venerated Renaissance technique of silverpoint to create sensuous and evocative abstractions. As seen in Strata #154, her drawings consist of patterns of repeating and interrupted horizontal lines and forms, meticulously hand drawn with a stylus of silver or other metal. Using subtle shifts of luminous tone and color, she creates a shimmering atmospheric effect often inspired by her own specific memories of light. Though her use of metalpoint is somewhat unconventional, her abstract drawings convey both the spirit and beauty of this centuries-old technique. ",
