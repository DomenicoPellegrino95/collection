  "text": "This elaborate ink stick takes the form of a <I>ju-i<I> scepter. The term <I>ju-i<I> means \"as desired\" or \"as you wish\". The uniquely shaped scepter is an ancient auspicious symbol that became the mark of a cultivated person. Old paintings often depict scholars holding <I>ju-i> scepters while engaged in conversation. Commemorative ink sticks, which were made in a wide variety of shapes during the nineteenth century, were produced for the scholar class and were common gifts. An ink stick as unusual as this one was likely intended for display only.",
