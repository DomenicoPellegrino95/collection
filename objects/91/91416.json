  "text": "This profoundly introspective portrait is thought to be the work of James Reid Lambdin of Philadelphia. Delia was a slave at Mount Repose, the plantation of Lambdin's brother Samuel Hopkins Lambdin, near Natchez, Mississippi. Few painted portraits of slaves along the Mississippi have come to light, and little is known of Delia's life. Her dignified pose and the presence of her portrait among Lambdin's paintings of his brother's family suggest that she was a valued member of the household.",
