  "text": "By the middle of the Warring States period (475-221 b.c.), the finest eating utensils made for elegant dining were being made of lacquer. Thinly carved, wooden objects were protected with several coats of lacquer creating a light, durable vessel. Decorated, with geometric and curvilinear designs in black on orange lacquer, this rare cup has survived intact with its quatrefoil-shaped cup stand made of gilt bronze. Known in China as \"ear cups\", this type of vessel was typically used for drinking wine.\r\n<P>This well-preserved example displays crescent-shaped handles, a style that began in the fourth century b.c. and remained popular throughout the Han dynasty (206 b.c.-220 a.d.). Several gilt bronze cup stands of similar form were discovered in a royal tomb in the vicinity of the mausoleum of the Han emperor Wu Ti (156-87 b.c.), in 1982 in Shensi province.",
