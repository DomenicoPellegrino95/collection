  "text": "Male weavers from Ghana and Togo produce distinctive textiles that are popularly known as <I>Kente cloth<I>. <I>Kente<I> is composed of many narrow-woven strips, from three to five inches wide, which are sewn together lengthwise to create wrappers in a variety of sizes. A man's cloth usually contains 18 - 24 strips, ranges from nine to eleven feet long and is worn much like a Roman Toga. Women have traditionally worn two small wrappers as an ensemble. <I>Kente<I> is only worn for ceremonial or celebratory occasions.\r\n\r\nThis woman's wrapper is representative of kente produced by weavers of the Ewe culture.  Ewe cloths are identifiable by their relatively simple design, the use of two colors of yarn plied together to provide a heather-tone in the weft stripes and the occasional use of figurative imagery between the blocks of colors.  The simple blue and white stripe background of this cloth relates it to very early Ewe weavings which used natural cotton and indigo-dyed warp threads.\r\n",
