  "description": "One of two caps of the type worn near Rouen. The crowns are made of darned work on a bobbin ground with Lille type r√©seau. The deep, falling borders of the caps are stiffly starched muslin, pleated at the back and edged with pillow lace in a design of floral sprays. The caps are open at the back and wired along the opening with thin strands of silk-covered wire.",
