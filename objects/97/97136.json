  "text": "People of the nomadic Tuareg group do not produce textiles, relying instead on artisans from neighboring cultures to supply cloth for clothing and domestic furnishings. Itinerant Fulani weavers visit Tuareg encampments where they seek and fulfill commissions for woolen blankets and tent hangings. Although the Fulani weavers utilize the same loom, materials and techniques for these items as for their own blankets, the design is quite different from traditional Fulani objects, and reflect the aesthetic preferences of the Tuareg.",
