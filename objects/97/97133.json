  "text": "Tu Ta-chung, a Ming official, was a noted Suchou calligrapher and a member of the Wu school group of writers associated with Wang Chih-teng (1535-1612). This calligraphy fan, carefully written in <I>hsiao-k'ai-shu<I> (small regular script), is an extraordinarily dense prose-poem composed by the T'ang poet Yang Chiung (650-ca.694) titled \"Prosepoem While Leaning on the Study Desk.\" The verse recounts the serious rigor of true scholarship. A few lines read thusly:\r\n\r\n<P><I>Scholars have transmitted the classics and are involved in extending knowledge to the utmost...They have exerted themselves in study questing after improvement...How can a scholar sleep in peaceful withdrawal'...Let him emulate the national craftsmen and develop their skill. May he model himself on mountains and forests, taking them as his pattern...<I>\r\n\r\n<P><I>Above is the prosepoem \"While Learning on the Study Desk.\" Wan-li year i-yu (1558), ninth month at the first appearance of the moon, I was returning by boat from P'ing-ling. We took the route that goes by Hsi-ch'iu. Here I saw the clustered peaks in the misty rain, no less beautiful than a painting. I saw this fine fan lying on my desk, and so roughly brushed this to record my inspiration. But I do feel ashamed that my calligraphy is unskillful.<I>\r\n                                                                                          <P><I>Tu Ta-chung<I>",
