  "text": "Anthropologist, photographer/photojournalist, and humanist, Sebastião Salgado questions in his work the contemporary ideas of humanity. In <I>Serra Pelada Goldmine, Brazil <I>(1986) he illustrates the inhumane working conditions that took place as the rush for gold fueled the economy in his native country.\r\n\r\nSalgado's haunting images of the tens of thousands of workers that excavated this huge gold mine challenge the imagination. Entirely by human hands, on the backs of native prospectors seeking a better existence, a mountain disappeared.\r\n",
