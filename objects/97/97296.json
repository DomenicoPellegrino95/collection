  "description": "Bedspread, rose and silver brocade, with a thickly massed pattern of leaves emanating from a sort of vase shape and leading up to a fruit form. Flanking the vase motif is a round form, possibly a fruit, fringed with broad flat leaves. The intervening spaces are filled with blossoms, smaller leaves, and fruits. The spread is made up of numerous pieces of the brocade seamed together. Fringe of crimson silk and silver threads. Lining of gold-colored silk, torn and stained. The silver threads of the brocade are broken and worn in many places.",
