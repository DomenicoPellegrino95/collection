  "text": "A Vermont Yankee by way of Wisconsin, Theodore Robinson was among the first American artists to visit Claude Monet at Giverny (1885 and 1887) and over an extended residence (1888-1892) came to enjoy a close personal relationship with the French artist.  Robinson achieved a style that combined his faithfulness to formal concerns with elements of impressionist style and was the single most important figure in the development of American Impressionism.\r\n<I>Farm Among Hills, Giverny</I> falls fully in Robinson's early explorations of the region when he employed high horizon lines and began developing his preferred color scheme of pale peach-pinks and lavenders contrasted against a range of greens.  Like several of his early works at Giverny, the present painting reflects the communal farming system that dictated the patchwork layout of fields on the hillsides for the cultivation of various crops.",
