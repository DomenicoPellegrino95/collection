  "text": "An unknown American craftsman created this weathervane in the form of a leaping deer in the last quarter of the 19th century.   The three-dimensional copper form, ears, tail, and lead-filled, half-round antlers were all hand-hammered, probably using wooden forms carved by the artist.  The delicately modeled head is of cast zinc. The hand-applied gilded surface is remarkably intact, with minor weathering and bullet dents, both consistent with outdoor use. A rare form of deer weathervane, it is one of only three known examples by this anonymous maker.",
