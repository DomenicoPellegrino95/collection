  "text": "Hassam's painting of the Sixth Avenue El is a visual manifestation of the artist's own assertion, two years prior, that \"humanity in motion is a continual study for me.\" Massive immigration had set off a population explosion in Manhattan during the nineteenth century, and the new inhabitants began to spread to north Manhattan and the boroughs beyond. The availability of mass transportation, such as the El (elevated train), was crucial both to the expansion of the population as well as to the management of its flow between work and home.\r\nFrom a raised viewpoint, Hassam captures the rush of an incoming train (at left) and the bustle of the street (at right), and merges the two in a perspectival rush to the distance. The lights of the train counter the streetlamps on the street as the pedestrians in between keep to the pace of their respective schedules. There is, nonetheless, a visual poetry to this scene of day's end-an aspect that the artist acknowledges in appending the musical word \"nocturne\" to the end \r\nof the title.",
