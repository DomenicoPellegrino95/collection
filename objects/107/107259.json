  "text": "This study of \"Tissy,\" a small spaniel identified by her name in the inscription in the lower right corner of the sheet, is by a skillful hand. We have been unable to identify the artist, but his tender portrayal of the creature would seem to reveal a real fondness for his subject. The dog is shown in an enviably restful slumber, utterly relaxed with her paws extended and head deep in sleep. Her soft fur and small head, reworked a bit around the snout, beckon to be petted. ",
