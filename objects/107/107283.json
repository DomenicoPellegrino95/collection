  "text": "While drawing connoisseurship can seem dangerously subjective to the uninitiated, quite often consensus is found among various experts. In this instance, three drawings connoisseurs independently suggested this quickly sketched study of a barking dog was executed by a Sienese artist around 1600, with one scholar venturing a more specific attribution to the Sienese painter Alessandro Casolani (1552-1606). More research must be undertaken to accept or reject this particular proposal, yet the agreement in perceiving a Sienese hand in this drawing reveals the rarified specialization of connoisseurship, while perhaps not scientific, can be quite reliable and accurate.",
