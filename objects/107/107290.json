  "text": "The composition of this <I>St. Jerome</I> by an unknown Italian artist derives ultimately from a famous engraving of 1602 by Agostino Carracci (1557-1602). Although the overall spirit of the work is Bolognese and reminiscent of Ludovico Carracci (1555-1619), the loose handling, especially in the saint's head, indicates a date of execution in the late 17th century or early 18th century.\r\n\r\nThis scene depicts St. Jerome in a secluded Syrian Desert cave to which he withdrew around 378. During the years he spent in the desert, he studied Hebrew, which he later used when translating the Old and New Testaments into Latin. St. Jerome holds a crucifix in one hand while the other rests on a skull; attributes that served as reminders: the crucifix represents his devotion to Christ while the skull acts as a <I>memento mori</I>, a reminder of death, and the vanity of earthly pursuits.",
