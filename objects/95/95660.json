  "text": "The earliest lead glazed pottery has been found in the tombs of middle Western Han (c. 100 b.c.). This was a revolutionary ware in that it marked the beginning of controlled, colored glazes, primarily the colors green, yellow, and brown. This <I>hu<I> takes the form of a bronze vessel complete with molded <I>t'ao-tieh<I> mask handles affixed with rings. The second <I>hu<I>, shown to the left, is brown glazed and molded with a lively hunting scene around its shoulder. The shapes and lead glaze colors seen here are typical of Han storage jars made for burial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
