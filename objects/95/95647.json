  "text": "Excavations in the vicinity of Shanghai have yielded a unique type of unglazed high-fired stoneware impressed on the exterior with a fine woven mesh pattern. Regardless of shape or size, the wares are light, thin-walled, hand-built vessels with unusually elegant forms. Decoration is minimal. In addition to the signature overall impressed textile pattern, some handles are incised with crosshatching and appliqué spiral patterns. The exact function of these rare containers is unknown. They may have been used only for burial.",
