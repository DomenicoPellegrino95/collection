  "text": "Several years ago Jon Riis became enamored with verdure tapestries and was particularly drawn to their exuberance of greenery and flowing movement.   His fascination with these elements is clearly seen in this tapestry/sculpture commissioned by the museum, which was specifically inspired by the verdure tapestry owned by the institute. (See the tapestry on the south wall of this gallery.)\r\n\r\nThe serene energy embodied in the outer design and elegance of the gold thread interior are juxtaposed with the implied threat presented by the meticulously rendered insects.  These tensions are frequently embodied in Riis's work as he encourages the viewer to consider if life is really what it seems.  \r\n",
