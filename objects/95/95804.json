  "text": "DL: In 1997, Polidori was commissioned by the New Yorker to do a portfolio on California modernism in Palm Springs for a piece called “Desert Cool” by Kurt Andersen. The photographs were conceived for the New Yorker, but they turned out to be terrific and he decided to make them available to collectors. \r\nMW: Yes, this is a very popular print. Photographers don’t typically single out their favorite photographs. But I asked Robert one time, “Do you keep any images for yourself' What do you have at the apartment'” I’d been at his apartment and studio. And he said, “You know, one of my very favorite pictures is the Gas Station in Palm Springs.”",
