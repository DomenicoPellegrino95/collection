  "text": "The exact name and purpose of these works are controversial. Most excavation reports identify objects like these as <I>ch'uan<I>, a type of bronze measure. Other scholars believe them to be modeled on a type of bronze musical instrument, which was suspended as bells in graduated sets and struck on the exterior to create music. No matter what they replicate, this set has no practical function and should be seen purely as funerary ware for the afterlife.",
