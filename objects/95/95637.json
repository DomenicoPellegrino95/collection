  "text": "This rare hand scroll, depicting various types of traditional trees and rocks, was painted by the great seventeenth century literatus, Tung Ch'i-Ch'ang. The work was intended for studio use as a type of source book for Tung's personal style of depicting trees and rocks, which he synthesized from the styles of previous masters. Sketchbooks, scrolls such as this, and printed manuals were commonly used as reference materials and teaching devices in Chinese painting workshops. This particular scroll was once in the possession of the literati artist, Ch'en Chi-ju (1558-1639), a close friend and follower of Tung Ch'i-Ch'ang.\r\n<P>Ch'en's colophon reads:\r\n<P><I>This is Hsuan-tsai's (Tung Ch'i-Ch'ang) sketch of trees and rocks by various old masters. Whenever he made a large composition, he copied from these sketches. After his house was burned down, I chanced to acquire this scroll from a professional mounter. It must not be shown to Tung lest it provoke his anxiety.<I>\r\n<P><I>Remarks by Mei-kung (Ch'en Chi-ju).<I>",
