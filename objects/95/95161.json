  "text": "This is not the average child's rocking horse. Its minimalist design allowed American children to rethink the horse-and-rider scenario and instead become a fighter pilot locked in a dogfight with the Luftwaffe or an astronaut flying to the moon in a space shuttle. Creative Playthings holds true to the same ideals they had in the 1950s and 1960s: creating educational, simple, and abstracted modern toys for children, primarily out of wood.",
