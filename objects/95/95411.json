  "text": "The major automobile companies have used various means to explore their car body designs, ranging from overall aerodynamics to specific detailing and colors. Early on, they employed skillful craftsman to create models in clay and wood and subsequently, hyper-realistic airbrush renderings. Today, most working schematics and formal presentations result from computer software.\r\n\r\nThis futuristic model was made specifically to test paint development and patterns, particularly how sheen, color, and gloss would interact with a car's form when viewed from different angles.",
