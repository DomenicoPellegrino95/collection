  "text": "This elegant figure of a gloriously festooned striding stallion is remarkable for its large size and detailed modeling. The basic style, including slender legs, powerfully arched neck, small head, large saddle blanket, and exquisitely modeled trappings, is peculiar to the Northern Wei (385-535), Eastern Wei (534-539), and Northern Ch'i (549-577) dynasties. Horses were highly valued during this period and the great imperial mounts, symbols of wealth and prestige, were magnificently decorated showpieces that were ridden with pride by their owners.\r\n<P>A classic example of the style, this image is also notable for the amount of red and white pigment it retains following centuries of burial as well its size, for it is apparently the largest example of this type of Northern Ch'i horse on record.",
