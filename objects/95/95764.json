  "text": "In spite of its literary subject matter, the classical theme of this hand scroll has allowed a skilled professional artist to produce an extensive, luxurious tour de force of great decorative effect while still adhering to the traditions and examples of past masters like Ch'iu Ying (early 16th century) and T'ang Yin (1470-1523). Both these artists specialized in detailed fine-line, colorful paintings that often included figures in architectural scenes.\r\n<P>This scroll depicts groups of scholars in a garden setting engaging in various literati pursuits. Reading from the right, a lone scholar and his attendant arrive at a lotus pond. The next scene shows officials seated at two tables engaged in painting activities and reading old books. Next depicted are scholars playing the game of Go on a veranda. The ensuing scene shows comfortably seated scholars drinking wine about to be entertained by women musicians. This group is followed by a large table set with ancient, bronze vessels waiting to be studied and appreciated for their antiquity. The final scene depicts a small group enjoying the music of the <I>ch'in<I>, the ancient stringed instrument associated with the literati class.",
