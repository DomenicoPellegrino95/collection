  "text": "This extremely rare tomb sculpture shows a T'ang official in Kowtow (<I>charise k'o-t'ou<I>). It was court practice to kneel and touch the forehead to the ground in token of homage and deep respect, especially to the emperor and high officials. The Confucian philosophy, with its emphasis on social hierarchy and court etiquette, stands behind this type of activity. Confucius taught that national harmony could be achieved through the rigid maintenance of the family hierarchy, respect for elders, ritual conduct, and total deference to court authority. The largest known figure of its type, this sculpture was undoubtedly interred in the tomb of a high T'ang official, most likely along with several other clay figures of ministers comprising a court scene.",
